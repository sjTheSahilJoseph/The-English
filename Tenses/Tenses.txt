Let's start by seeing these 2 sentences:
    1. He is always talking about his work whenever they meet.
    2. He is always going for a walk after dinner.
    If I ask you to find the mistake in both sentences.
    You will probably say:
        These sentences should look like this:
            1. He always talks about his work whenever they meet.
            2. He always goes for a walk after dinner.
        But this is wrong.
            1st sentences is totally right.
            But yes, for 2nd sentences we will correct it by "He always goes...".

Take a look at this:
    There is a sentences:
        1. SJ writes a letter.
            What If I ask you that find the subject, verb and object.
                Subject = SJ;
                Writes = Verb;
                A Letter = Object;
            And I ask that what is the object of this sentences, and what is the subject of this sentences.
                Most people say that SJ is the subject of the sentences, writes is the verb of the sentences, a letter is the object of this sentences.
            But this is false.
            There is no subject, object, verb of a sentences.
                Subject is the subject of Verb.
                Object is the object of Verb.
            There is nothing called the subject of sentences or object of sentences.

Verb is Important:
    In that case, we have to learn about Verb.
    Verb is super Important.
        For Example:
            Tenses are based on Verb.
            Voice is based on Verb.
            Subject / Subject Complement is based on Verb.
            Mostly stuff in English is based on Verb.
    If I ask you what is verb?
        You'll probably say:
            Verb is a word which tells about the action of state of being.
        Yes it is right, but Verb is more than that.
    
Right way of Understanding Verb:
    In order to understand Verb, we need to understand its categories:
        Verb has 2 Categories:
            1. Helping Verb.
                Helping Verb:
                    Helping Verb has also 2 Categories:
                        1. Primary.
                            Primary Helping Verb.
                                Primary Helping Verb has also 3 Categories:
                                    1. Be.
                                        Is the meaning of Be is Be?
                                            No.
                                        Be = is/am/are/was/were.
                                    2. Have.
                                        Have = has/have/had.
                                    3. Do.
                                        Do = do/does/did.
                        2. Modals.
                            There are total 13 Modal Verbs:
                                Modals = can/could/may/might/shall/should/will/would/must/dare/need/used to/ought to.
            2. Main Verb.
                Main Verbs = which tells the Action.
                    For Example:
                        Write, Play, Talk, etc...

Why understanding verbs is Important in order to learn tenses:
    There are some points:
        1. Helping Verbs comes before the Main Verbs.
            Helping Verbs has 2 Categories:
                1. Primary
                2. Modals.
            When Primary Helping Verbs combined with Main Verbs, the chapter of "Tenses" pops out.
            When Modals Helping Verb combined with Main Verbs, the chapter of "Modals" pops out.
    Summary:
        Primary Helping Verbs + Main Verbs = Tenses.
        Modals Helping Verb + Main Verbs = Modals.

What are Tenses?
    A set of verb form.
        What is Verb?
            The Action Word.
        When any action happens, we need to know the time of that action. Right?
            Like, Is that action happened in past? future? or in the present?
    Tense is the part of verb that tells the time of that action, like, when the action happened or will happen.
    But how?
        In order to know the time of that action, we change the form of verb.
    Forms of Verb:
        There are total 5 forms of verb:
            1. Verb 1st form = play;
            2. Verb 2nd form = played;
            3. Verb 3rd form = played;
            4. Verb 4th form (ing) = playing;
            5. Verb 5th form (s/es) = plays;
    For Example:
        1. SJ plays hockey. (Present)
        2. SJ played hockey. (Past)
        3. SJ will play hockey. (Future)
            Did you see? The difference?
            I used different form of verb to tell the time of the same action. But by changing the form of verb, the whole time changed of that action.

For Different Times has Different Parts in Tenses:
    1. Preset.
    2. Past.
    3. Future.
        All of them has 4 Parts:
            1. Indefinite.
            2. Continuous.
            3. Perfect.
            4. Perfect Continuous.
    There are total 12 Tenses.
        For 12 Tenses, the form of verb will change.
