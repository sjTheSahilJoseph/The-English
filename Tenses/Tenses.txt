Let's start by seeing these 2 sentences:
    1. He is always talking about his work whenever they meet.
    2. He is always going for a walk after dinner.
    If I ask you to find the mistake in both sentences.
    You will probably say:
        These sentences should look like this:
            1. He always talks about his work whenever they meet.
            2. He always goes for a walk after dinner.
        But this is wrong.
            1st sentences is totally right.
            But yes, for 2nd sentences we will correct it by "He always goes...".

Take a look at this:
    There is a sentences:
        1. SJ writes a letter.
            What If I ask you that find the subject, verb and object.
                Subject = SJ;
                Writes = Verb;
                A Letter = Object;
            And I ask that what is the object of this sentences, and what is the subject of this sentences.
                Most people say that SJ is the subject of the sentences, writes is the verb of the sentences, a letter is the object of this sentences.
            But this is false.
            There is no subject, object, verb of a sentences.
                Subject is the subject of Verb.
                Object is the object of Verb.
            There is nothing called the subject of sentences or object of sentences.

Verb is Important:
    In that case, we have to learn about Verb.
    Verb is super Important.
        For Example:
            Tenses are based on Verb.
            Voice is based on Verb.
            Subject / Subject Complement is based on Verb.
            Mostly stuff in English is based on Verb.
    If I ask you what is verb?
        You'll probably say:
            Verb is a word which tells about the action of state of being.
        Yes it is right, but Verb is more than that.
    
Right way of Understanding Verb:
    In order to understand Verb, we need to understand its categories:
        Verb has 2 Categories:
            1. Helping Verb.
                Helping Verb:
                    Helping Verb has also 2 Categories:
                        1. Primary.
                            Primary Helping Verb.
                                Primary Helping Verb has also 3 Categories:
                                    1. Be.
                                        Is the meaning of Be is Be?
                                            No.
                                        Be = is/am/are/was/were.
                                    2. Have.
                                        Have = has/have/had.
                                    3. Do.
                                        Do = do/does/did.
                        2. Modals.
                            There are total 13 Modal Verbs:
                                Modals = can/could/may/might/shall/should/will/would/must/dare/need/used to/ought to.
            2. Main Verb.
                Main Verbs = which tells the Action.
                    For Example:
                        Write, Play, Talk, etc...

Why understanding verbs is Important in order to learn tenses:
    There are some points:
        1. Helping Verbs comes before the Main Verbs.
            Helping Verbs has 2 Categories:
                1. Primary
                2. Modals.
            When Primary Helping Verbs combined with Main Verbs, the chapter of "Tenses" pops out.
            When Modals Helping Verb combined with Main Verbs, the chapter of "Modals" pops out.
    Summary:
        Primary Helping Verbs + Main Verbs = Tenses.
        Modals Helping Verb + Main Verbs = Modals.

What are Tenses?
    A set of verb form.
        What is Verb?
            The Action Word.
        When any action happens, we need to know the time of that action. Right?
            Like, Is that action happened in past? future? or in the present?
    Tense is the part of verb that tells the time of that action, like, when the action happened or will happen.
    But how?
        In order to know the time of that action, we change the form of verb.
    Forms of Verb:
        There are total 5 forms of verb:
            1. Verb 1st form = play;
            2. Verb 2nd form = played;
            3. Verb 3rd form = played;
            4. Verb 4th form (ing) = playing;
            5. Verb 5th form (s/es) = plays;
    For Example:
        1. SJ plays hockey. (Present)
        2. SJ played hockey. (Past)
        3. SJ will play hockey. (Future)
            Did you see? The difference?
            I used different form of verb to tell the time of the same action. But by changing the form of verb, the whole time changed of that action.

For Different Times has Different Parts in Tenses:
    1. Preset.
    2. Past.
    3. Future.
        All of them has 4 Parts:
            1. Indefinite.
            2. Continuous.
            3. Perfect.
            4. Perfect Continuous.
    There are total 12 Tenses.
        For 12 Tenses, the form of verb will change.

Present Indefinite.
    Take a look at these sentences:
        1. He is always talking about his work whenever they meet.
        2. He is always going for a walk after dinner.
        Most people will say the first sentences is wrong and the second one is also wrong, But the truth is the first sentences is correct and yes the second one is wrong.
            But why the first sentences is correct?
                Let's find out.
    What is Present Indefinite Tense?
        Structure:
            Subject + Verb 1st Form + s/es.
                When we need to put e/es?
                    In singular case we add es/s.
                    In plural case we don't add es/s
                        Now another question: What should be singular? to Check weather we need to put s/es or not. The subject? The object? the verb? What?
                            Some people might say : Verb.
                            But the truth is both the subject and verb have to be singular or plural to math the s/es case.

Noun.
    Noun = Naming Word.
        By the way, noun is more than just naming word, but we'll learn more about it later.
    Verb = Action Word.
    In English language, if there is a singular noun, and we add s/es, then the noun becomes plural. Yes, there are many nouns which don't follow the way. But most of them are.
        For Example:
            Singular = Chair;
            Plural = Chairs;
            Singular = Bench;
            Plural = Benches;
    But in the context of Verb, this same rule is opposite.
        For Example:
            Singular = Writes;
            Plural = Write;
            Singular = Walks;
            Plural = Walk;
        The 1st form of verb is always in the plural form naturally.
        And If we add s/es to the plural form the 1st form of verb, then the verb becomes singular.
    If the subject is singular then the form of verb should also be singular.
    If the subject is plural then the form of verb should also be plural.

How to make singular / plural verb?
    If the subject is singular then the form of verb should also be singular.
        By adding s/es to the 1st form of verb.
    If the subject is plural then the form of verb should also be plural.
        By default its plural.

But What is singular subject and what is plural subject?
    Singular Subject - Singular Verb:
        He/She/It - walks, talks, etc...
    Plural Subject - Plural verb:
        I/We/You/They - walk, talk, etc...
    But wait a second, I = singular right? So why it is in the plural category?
        Because I is an exception in English Language.
        I is singular but it is considered as plural.
        In Pronoun, we count I as first person singular, but in tense context, I is plural.
    
I:
    I - first person singular.
        But only in 2 places:
            When:
                I + am.
                1 + was.
        Otherwise, in the whole tenses:
            I - plural.
        For Example:
            I - has = Wrong.
            I - have = Right.
            I - does = Wrong.
            I - do = Right.
            I - writes = Wrong.
            I - write = Right.
    This rule is followed in all the tenses.
        I works as plural for all the tenses except for those where we use am/was with I.
    
In present Indefinite the I:
    We use plural verbs with I in present Indefinite.
    Structure:
        Subject + Verb 1st form + s/es.
    
Important Uses of Present Indefinite Tense:
    1. Habitual/Repeated Actions of Present.
        For Example:
            1. My mother goes to temple everyday.
            2. I get up early in the morning.
            3. My father works late at night.
            In fact, most of us already know us in Schools, but then also we was unable to tell the error in this sentences right?
                sentence:
                    He is always talking about his work whenever they meet.
                Why?
                    Because if we translate the English sentence into Hindi/Urdu, then we can never get the right idea.
                So then, How can we identify?
                    By TIME.
                Time is the key.
                    There are many words which tells about time of the Repeated action or Habitual actions.
                    In English, anywhere these words are present, after seeing them in a sentence, we can quickly understand that this sentence is talking about Habitual/Repeated action.

Note:
    Time expressions of Habitual Actions:
        Every day / Every night / Every week / Every month / Every Year / Every evening / Every morning / Daily / Seldom / Never / Occasionally / Frequently / Often / Usually / Generally / Once a day/week/month / Twice a day/week/year / Hardly / Rarely / Scarcely / etc...
    Yes, they have some exceptions, but we'll discuss them later.
    But mostly, we can quickly know that this should be Present Indefinite Tense.
        (Subject + Verb 1st form + s/es).
    For Example:
        1. He is going everyday for a morning walk with his friends and neighbors.
            But why is going? Like we understood that if there is everyday present, then it must be present Indefinite tense right?
                So it is wrong,
            The correct sentence is:
                He goes everyday for a morning walk with his friends and neighbors.
        2. During the holidays I am often working in my uncle's school to earn some pocket money.
            Often = Present Indefinite.
            I = Singular but Plural.
            working = wrong, works = wrong because of I, work = right.
            So this sentence is wrong.
            The right is:
                During the holidays I often work in my uncle's school to earn some pocket money.
        3. Although she is a very good friend of mine yet she is hardly talking to me.
            She = singular.
            hardly = Preset Indefinite.
            So why "is hardly talking?" it is wrong.
            Correct:
                Although she is a very good friend of mine yet she hardly talks to me.
        4. Everyone likes her in the office because she is seldom coming later.
            Again the same mistake.
            This is wrong.
            The right version:
                Everyone likes her in the office because she seldom comes late.
        
Take a look at these sentences again:
    1. He is always talking about his work whenever they meet.
    2. He is always going for a walk after dinner.
    It seems that they both are telling about a Habitual action. Right?
    But how? Because of always?
        Then you're wrong. Because always was not in that list which I showed you.
        Always is an exception.
            Why?

Always:
    There are 2 uses of always:
        1. Habit.
            Subject + Verb 1st form + s/es.
        2. Irritation.
            Subject + is/am/are + verb 1st form + ing.
    When always tells about the Habit, it becomes a present Indefinite tense.
    & When always is used to describe irritation, We don't use present Indefinite tense anymore. We use present Continuous tense.
        (Subject + is/am/are + Verb 1st form + ing).
    For Example:
        1. She is always speaking the truth. = Wrong.
            It is a Habitual sentence. So it should be present Indefinite tense. But it is preset Continuous, so it is wrong.
        2. She always speaks the truth. = Correct.
        3. She always complains about her husband. = Wrong.
            It is irritation sentence with always, so we don't use present Indefinite here. We use present Continuous.
        4. She is always complaining about her husband. = Correct.
    We need to understand the sense of that sentences.

Now Take a look at these sentences again:
    1. He is always talking about his work whenever they meet. = Irritation so we use present Continuous. = Right.
    2. He is always going for a walk after dinner. = Habit so we use present Indefinite, but here it is written in present Continuous which is wrong.
        The correct version is:
            He always goes for a walk after dinner.

Next type of Present Indefinite:
    Take a look at these sentences and try to find an error:
        1. The people in ancient time believed that the Sun moves round the Earth.
        2. The scientist believed that the gravitational force pulls down everything.
        The first sentence is wrong, and the second one is correct.
        In first sentence, "moves" is wrong, is should be "moved".
        And in second sentence, "pulls" is right.
        But why?
            Let's find out.

2. Present Indefinite use no. 2 = Universal Truth / Facts.
    Universal Truth / Facts means they don't change.
    In these type of use case, we use present Indefinite tense.
    For Example:
        1. The Earth moves round the Sun.
            Universal Truth = true;
            Earth = singular so Verb "moves" = Singular.
        2. The Sun rises in the east.
            Sun = singular so Verb "rises" = Singular.
        3. Plants give us oxygen.
            Plants = plural so Verb "give" = Plural.

Now take a look again at these sentence:
    1. The people in ancient time believed that the Sun moves round the Earth.
    2. The scientist believed that the gravitational force pulls down everything.
    Where is the Universal Truth or where its not?
    In the first sentence, this is not an Universal truth. Because now we know that this is false.
        So it is Universal truth? Not at all.
            So "moves" is not correct for this, we need to write "moved" as it is past (believed). so we need to make it past as well.
            But if its like:
                The people in ancient time believed that the Earth moves round the Sun.
                    Then yes, it is correct 100%.
    In second sentence, this is Universal truth, fact.
        So it is correct. So we use present Indefinite tense here.
    
Next type of Present Indefinite Tense.
    Take a look at these sentence:
        1. The train leaves at 5:30 in the evening.
        2. The train will leave at 5:30 in the evening.
        Most people might say that the first sentence is wrong because it is not telling about any Habit.
        But the 2nd sentence is right, because it fits as it is a future sentence.
        But the thing is both of them are correct.
        As we know that they both sentences are talking about past but why we used present Indefinite in the first sentence?
            Let's figure out.
        We can use present tense for future but with some limitations.

3. Fixed Actions in Future - 3rd use of Present Indefinite Tense.
    Before we understand about this category, let's know some basic points of Future:
        For Future Tense, the Structure:
            Subject + Will/Shall + Verb 1st form.
            For Example:
                1. I shall go to US tomorrow.
                2. He will buy a flat soon.
                3. The PM will give a speech tomorrow.
        Future has 2 categories:
            1. Fixed Actions Future.
            3. Not Fixed Actions Future.
        Not Fixed Action Future:
            Where the the action is not fixed like 50%, 60%, etc...
        Fixed Action Action Future:
            Where the action is Fixed like 99.99%.
                1% is exception because it can also not be done by some reason but it is fixed.
        Which sentence is a fixed action and which is not?
            1. I shall go to US tomorrow. = Not Fixed.
            2. He will buy a flat soon. = Not Fixed.
            3. The PM will give a speech tomorrow. = Fixed because there is a higher chance it must be happen, because PM is a responsible seat.. etc..
        It's all about sense.
    Doesn't matter weather it's fixed or not fixed future. We use will/shall in future tense.
    But if the future is fixed then we can also use present Indefinite tense.
    But not in not fixed action future.
    Like:
        Subject + Will/Shall + Verb 1st form = Fixed / Not Fixed.
        Subject + Verb 1st form + es/s = Only in Fixed.
            it is used to minimize the words.
    For Example:
        1. The P.M will give a speech tomorrow. = Right.
        2. The P.M gives a speech tomorrow. = Right.
        3. The match will start at 7 in the evening. = Right.
        4. The match starts at 7 in the evening. = Right.
    Test:
        1. The train leaves at 5:30 in the evening. = Correct as its fixed future, so we can use present Indefinite as well.
            Focus on the verb "leaves" time can be change but focus on verb.
        2. My grandfather retires on 26th November.
            Correct.
        3. The school reopens in July.
            Correct.

Present Indefinite Tense.
    Affirmative - (Subject + Verb 1st form + s/es).
        3 Uses:
            1. Habitual/Repeated Action.
            2. Universal Truth/Facts.
            3. Fixed Future.
    Interrogative/Negative - (Not, Do/Does).
        For Interrogative/Negative the Structure changes.
    
Interrogative.
    Structure:
        Do/Does + Subject + Verb 1st Form?
        For Example:
            1. Does she go to college?
            2. Does she talk to anyone?
            3. Do we need him?
        We don't use s/es with verb, because with do/does we don't add s/es with verb as do/does is helping verb.
        If the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, So do = plural, does = singular. with does its already with s/es do+es.

Negative:
    Structure:
        Subject + Do/Does + not + Verb 1st form.
        For Example:
            1. She does not go to college.
            2. She does not talk to anyone.
            3. We do not need him.
        We don't use s/es with verb, because with do/does we don't add s/es with verb as do/does is helping verb.
        If the subject is singular, the verb must be singular, So do = plural, does = singular. with does its already with s/es do+es.

Test:
    1. How often are you going to Gymnasium? = wrong.
        Here we need Interrogative Structure.
        Correct:
            How often do you go to Gymnasium.
        Because it is singular.
    2. Why don't you told him about the issue? = wrong.
        Correct:
            Why don't you tell him about the issue.
        Because it is present. So the past "told" is wrong.

Take a look at these sentences:
    1. I have asked this question from management three times.
    2. I have had lunch an hour ago.
    3. The earthquake had destroyed their city three years ago.
        1st sentence is correct, but 2nd and third are wrong.

Simple Past Tense (Verb 2nd form).
    Structure:
        Subject + Verb 2nd form.
    In the present indefinite tense, we have a rule of changing the verb like singular or plural. But here there is not rule like this. Doesn't matter the subject is singular or not. We always use verb 2nd form.

Uses of Simple Past Tense:
    1. Actions finished / completed in Past.
    For Example:
        1. I met your brother yesterday.
        2. My father went to Russia last year.
        3. She bought a car two weeks ago.
        All the actions here are finished. Like in the past.
    Now take a look at this sentence:
        1. I asked this question from management three times.
        According to the concept which we've learned sometime ago. This sentence should be correct right? But it's not. Like this is past so we added verb 2nd form "asked" but it is not correct here. We have to use have asked. Let's find out how and why?
    We have to understand the sense of the sentence. On the basis of time. "TIME"

Time Expressions of Finished Actions in past.
    Yesterday, Yesterday morning/evening...
    The day before yesterday...
    Ago, The other day...
    Last night...
    Last week...
    Last month...
    Last Year...
    In 1991...
    In July...
    etc...
    These are the times which tells about finished actions in past (verb 2nd form).

Let's take a look at this sentence.
    1. My. SJ and the other dissident leaders have taken shelter at the church last month after the authorities ordered their arrest.
        Verb = have taken = verb 3rd form.
        Time = last month = it means that the action is finished in the past. So, verb 2nd form.
            It means the verb is wrong here.
        Correct:            
            1. My. SJ and the other dissident leaders took shelter at the church last month after the authorities ordered their arrest.
    2. I have bought this house in 1970 for two lac.
        Verb = have bought = Verb 3rd form.
        Time = in 1970. = verb 2nd form.
        The sentence is wrong.
        Correct:
            2. I bought this house in 1970 for two lac.
    3. I have had lunch one hour ago.
        Time = ago = it means the action is finished, so 2nd form of verb.
        Verb = have had. = (by the way, have had etc.. Are like 1st have is helping verb and 2nd had is main verb.)
            Verb 3rd form.
        So it means that sentence is wrong.
        Correct:
            3. I had lunch one hour ago.
                had = 2nd form. [have had had having has]
    4. Three years ago an earthquake had destroyed their city; the people are still rebuilding their lives.
        Time = three years ago. = finished action in the past so 2nd form of verb.
        Verb = had destroyed. = it is 3rd form but we need 2nd form.
            had = delete; and destroyed = 2nd form and 3rd form are same.
        This sentence is wrong.
        Correct:            
            4. Three years ago an earthquake destroyed their city; the people are still rebuilding their lives.

Conclusion:
    We use 2nd form of verb when the action is finished in the past.
    And we can identify weather its finished in the past or not by Time.

Now take a look:
    1. It is opportune time the govt. Should take some strict actions against the rapist.
        This sentence is wrong, Let's find out why?

We use 2nd form of verb when the sentence is giving the sense of:
    1. It is opportune time...
    2. It is right time...
    3. It is high time...
    etc...
    These clauses give the sense of "It is the right time" ... Little late or should...
    And when the subject is present directly after these clauses, we use verb 2nd form.

For Example:
    1. It is high time I go to bed. = wrong.
    1. It is high time I went to bed. = right.
    2. It is about time she goes to the station. = wrong.
    2. It is about time she went to the station. = right.
    It doesn't means that this is past tense. It just gives the meaning of should & a little late.
    3. It is high time we should prepare for English. = wrong.
        Because it only gives the sense of should not directly should.
    3. It is high time we prepared for English. = right.
    4. It is time you eat food. = wrong.
    4. It is time you ate food. = right.
    5. It is opportune time the Govt. Should take some strict actions against the rapist. = wrong.
    5. It is opportune time the Govt. Took some strict actions against the rapist. = right.

Simple Past tense 3rd type:
    Habit of Past.

Habit of Past.
    Structure:
        Subject + used to + Verb 1st form.
    Why we use verb 1st form in simple past tense when we are use this use case "Habit of past"? Why not verb 2nd form?
    The reason behind this is not something like:
        We have already used to so ed is already there so we don't have to make it past. No no no.
        We use verb 1st form after to. no no no. It is also wrong.
    The reason is "used to" is a modal verb.
        We use verb 1st form after the modal verb always.
    Whenever we see subject + modal + verb 1st form. It means that this thing is past habit.
    For Example:
        1. I used to eat sand in childhood. = correct.
        2. I used to ate sand in childhood. = wrong.
        3. She used to play guitar in college. = correct.
        4. She used to played guitar in college. = wrong.

There is an use case where we use verb+ing form after used to.
    There are 2 kinds of habits:
        1. Habit of past.
        2. Habit of present.
    For habit of past, we use this structure:
        Subject + used to + verb 1st form.
    For habit of present, we use this structure:
        Subject + Be[am,is,are,was,were,be,..etc..] + used to + verb+ing.
            Because of present.
    For Example:
        1. I used to gamble. = correct = habit of past.
        2. I am used to gamble. = wrong = habit of present but we should use verb + ing.
        2. I am used to gambling. = correct. = habit of present.

For Negative and Interrogative:
    We use "did" helping verb and 1st form of verb.
    Why 1st form of verb in simple past tense?
        Because did is already a 2nd form of verb "do".
    For Negative:
        Structure:
            Subject + Did not + Verb 1st form.
    For Interrogative:
        Structure:
            Did + Subject + Verb 1st form.
    For Example:
        1. Did she eat food? = correct.
        2. Did she ate food? = wrong.
        3. Did she go to college? = correct.
        4. Did she went to college? = wrong.
        5. She did not eat food. = correct.
        6. She did not ate food. = wrong.
        7. She did not go to college. = correct.
        8. She did not went to college. = wrong.
