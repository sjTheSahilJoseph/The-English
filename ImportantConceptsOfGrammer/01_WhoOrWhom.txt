Who or Whom is quite confusing for most of people.
But it is quite simple.

Basic Formula:
    Who = Subject
    Whom = Object

Note:
    No sentences can be made without verb.
    No verb can live without subject.
    No subject can live without verb.

The common method:
    This method is not wrong but it can not work in some cases. Especially in complex sentences.
    The Method looks like this:
        In a sentences, after the who / whom place, remove the subject and verb, and then decide that if another verb is present, then it should be who. Because in English no sentences can be made without verb and if the verb is there the subject is must. So we use who as subject.
    For Example:
        1. He was the man (whom/who) they determined should be the next Chairman.
            First we find the Verb after the who/whom.
                Verb = They determined;
            Then we removed this verb.
                He was the man (who/whom) should be the next Chairman.
            Then we see that the if the verb is present of not after (who/whom).
                Should = verb and it is present.
            As we know no verb can sustain without subject, so we decide to have (who) as subject.
                But its wrong.
            The Correct sentence:
                He was the man whom they determined should be the next Chairman. => Correct.
    Yes it works, It is right but it doesn't work in some cases.
    For Example:
        The girls who we have selected in our team are playing hockey in the field.
            Same Method:
                The girls who (we => subject) (have selected => verb) [We remove them and then see, Like in this case, there is no verb present but "in our" is present which is not a verb. So we use the Object case. (Whom) because if there is no verb, there is no subject.] in our team are playing hockey in the field.
            And this is right.
                The correct sentence:
                    The girls whom we have selected in our team are playing hockey in the field. => Correct.
    But this method will not work always.
    Case when it will not work:
        For Example:
            1. The person (who/whom) they are referring to is none other than my close friend.
                Be removing "they are referring" and after is "to is" is = verb.
                So we need to add who instead of whom. But that's wrong.

The 100% Accuracy method:
    Point 1:
        Who = Subject.
        Whom = Object.
    Point 2:
        A subject can't come without a verb and a verb can't come without a subject.
    For Example:
        1. John is the man who you met at dinner last week.
            Just focus on Subject and Verb.
            Let's count the subject and verb combinations.
                1. John & is.
                2. you & met.
            Notice the "who" is written, but why? where is the verb of it?
                It means It is wrong.
            The correct sentence is:
                John is the man whom you met a dinner last week.
        2. He is the man who I know has helped my son in the final examination.
            Just focus on Subject and Verb.
            Let's count the subject and verb combinations.
                1. He & is.
                2. I & know.
                3. who & (helping verb and main verb combination are considered as one verb. (has helped)).
                    Now see, who can work as subject, so who should be use in this case.
            Notice the "who" is written, but why? where is the verb of it?
                has helped = verb of who.
            Correct sentence:
                This is correct.
        3. The boy who you see there made the top score in the last match.
            Just focus on Subject and Verb.
            Let's count the subject and verb combinations.
                1. Boy & made.
                    In starting, the boy is written but the verb of boy is not just next to it.
                        In this case, we see the whole picture of sentence to find its verb by meaning.
                2. you & see.
            The who is present, but where is its verb?
                No extra verb here. So it means it is wrong. We need to use Object case. (Whom).
            Correct:
                The boy whom you see there made the top score in the last match.
        4. Just before the race I asked him whom he thought was going to win.
            Subject Verb Combinations:
                1. I & asked.
                2. he & thought.
                3. ? & was going.
                    We need to have the who here as subject of this verb.
        5. The person who they are referring to is none other than my close friend.
            Subject = person.
            In order to find its verb, we need to see the whole picture of the sentence.
            is = verb of person.
            they = subject.
            are referring = verb of they.
            Now the who is remains. But why? and for Whom?
                That means, that sentence is not correct.
            The whom should be present in order to use it as Object because there is no verb for who is present.
        6. I know who this job should be entrusted to for smooth handling.
            Subject Verb Combinations:
                1. I & Know.
                2. This job & should be entrusted.
                    should be entrusted is in passive.
                    Actually should + verb 1st for is the modal verb.
                    Its passive is (should + verb 3rd form.).
            Who is written, but where is its verb?
                None.
                It means the whom should be present not who.
            Correct:
                I know whom this job should be entrusted to for smooth handling.
        7. He is certainly a man whom I know very well is trustworthy beyond doubt and meticulous in his habits.
            Subject + Verb Combinations:
                1. He & is.
                2. I & know.
                3. is (verb) + subject?
                    it means that the who should be there as subject.
        8. Various employees, whom we met, echoed the sentiments expressed by the CEO of the company.
            Point 1.
                Identify the verb correctly.
            Point 2.
                See the whole picture of sentence.
            Subject Verb Combinations:
                1. employees & expressed.
                    that's wrong.
                        Because it is not the verb of employees.
                1. employees & echoed.
                    correct.
                2. we & met.
                3. expressed & CEO.
                It means that there are all quotas are fulfilled of subject and verb combination.
                So the whom is correct.
        9. It is the need of the hour that we should help people whom we think are poor.
            Subject & Verb Combinations:
                1. It & is.
                2. should help & we.
                3. we & think.
                4. are & subject?

        11. He saw a gentleman (who/whom) he presumed to be the director, and told him about Helen.
            Subject & Verb Combinations:
                1. He & Saw.
                2. He & presumed.
                3. told (verb) & subject?
                    Most people thing that the told's subject is who. but that's not the case.
                        The thing is that the told is also for he. Why because he is the common verb.
                            For Example:
                                I can do and I will do. = I can and will do.
                        That doesn't means that only one subject can have 2 verbs. Basically there are 2 subject (he and he) and 2 verbs.
                    That's why take a complete look at sentence.
                    The correct:
                        He saw a gentleman whom he presumed to be the director, and told him about Helen.
        12. (Who/Whom) did the candidate choose for his running mate?
            This is a simple past tense.
                Interrogative = Did + Subject + Verb 1st form.
                    For example:
                        Did he eat food?
                            Did = helping verb.
                            eat = main verb.
                            did + eat = single verb.
                            he = subject in the middle.
                            food = Object.
            Did & choose = single verb.
                candidate = subject.
            Now remains is who / whom = who for subject and whom for Object.
            Here running is not the verb.
                In order to become verb, is am are.. should be present before running but that's not the case.
                It is adjective here (participle).
            Whom = correct.
        13. May I know to who I am speaking?
            To = preposition.
                after the preposition, the word is object of preposition.
            Who = subject but we need object for preposition.
            Whom = objective case.
            Whom correct.
        14. A number of friends went to the cinema, one of whom was the birthday boy.
            of = preposition.
            after preposition, the word is in objective case.
            So use objective case.
            whom = object.
            whom = correct.
