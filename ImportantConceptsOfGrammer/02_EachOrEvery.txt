Take a look at these sentences:
    1. My parents are arriving tomorrow, and every/each of them will be on a different plane.
    2. He has a ring on every/each finger.
    3. SJ is using different pencils every/each time.
    The correct answer is:
        1. each.
        2. every/each.
        3. each.
    
We'll understand Each and Every in 3 ways:
    1. Numbers.
    2. Parts of Speech.
    3. Individuals/Group.

Each.
    Used for two or more than two persons or things.

Every.
    Used for three or more than three persons or things.

For Example:
    1. She had paint on every leg.
        It is wrong, because every is used for 3 or more than 3 persons or things. And She is a human and human has 2 legs. So Every starts from 3 or more than 3.. That's why, we use Each.
        Correct:
            She had paint on each leg.
    2. My parents are arriving tomorrow, and every of them will be on a different plane.
        Wrong.
        Correct:
            My parents are arriving tomorrow, and each (because of two) of them will be on a different plane.
    3. He has a ring on every finger.
        It is right but it can also use each.
            Because, every finger, let's say 4. so 2<each, 3<every. We can use both.

Each.
    Each = Pronoun/Adjective.

Every.
    Every = Adjective.

For Example:
    1. Each of us has a bicycle. = Correct.
        Verb = has.
        subject?
            Each of us = of = Preposition so word after Preposition = object. us = object.
            subject = each.
            subject = Pronoun.
    2. Every of us has a bicycle. = Wrong.
        has = verb.
        subject = every. (but every is Adjective.)
            In order to make a subject, we need to have a noun/Pronoun.
            We can add "one" after every, then it's right.
            one = Pronoun and it can be subject.
            every = Adjective. which is right.
    3. Every one of us has a bicycle. = Correct.
        Every = Adjective.
        One = Pronoun.
        Of = Preposition.
        us = Object of Preposition.
        subject = one.
    4. Each of the children received a special gift. = Correct
        Verb = received.
        Of = Preposition.
        the children = object of Preposition
        subject = each.
        why? because no more word left and each is Pronoun so it can be subject.
    5. Every of the children received a special gift. = Wrong.
        Every = Adjective.
        So we need a subject and every = not a subject.
    6. Every one of the children received a special gift. = Correct.
        One = Pronoun.
        subject = One.
        Every = Adjective.

Note:
    In English, no sentences can be complete without verb, and no verb can be complete without subject.
    subject is always a noun or a Pronoun.
    Each = Pronoun.
    So when we need to have a subject, we use each.
    The word after Preposition is the object of Preposition.

Test.
    1. We have three windows; every has a great view. = Wrong.
        Not every time the way of time works.
        Sometimes we need to think more deeply.
        Take a look at verb.
            has is the verb.
            and verb needs a subject.
            in order to become a subject the subject must be noun / Pronoun.
            but every = Adjective.
            So, each is the correct answer.
        Correct:
            We have three windows; each has a great view.
    2. The dogs are unique. Every has different markings. = Wrong.
        has = verb.
        subject = every not possible.
        each = correct.
    Correct:
        The dogs are unique. Each has different markings.
        But If we want to write every then we can write Every + one and then it will be good.
    3. Every of the children received a present. = Wrong.
        Correct:
            Each/Every one.
    4. Every one of the windows was broken. = Correct.
    5. I've seen three films. Every was very interesting. = Wrong.
        Correct:
            I've seen three films. (Each/Every one) was very interesting.
    6. SJ has two sons and each one of them is brilliant in studies. = Wrong.
        two = each;
        verb = is;
        subject = every one;
        But wrong.
            two < each;
            each = Adjective here.
        Correct:
            SJ has two sons and each of them is brilliant in studies.
        yes, each can become Adjective as well.
    7. Each of my ten pens writes smoothly. = Correct.
        Number = 10;
        Verb = Writes;
        Preposition = Of;
        object of Preposition = my ten pens;
            my = Adjective;
            pens = object of Preposition;
        Each = subject;
            Each can come for more than 2 pens.

Each.
    Each is used when you are talking about an Individual person or item in a plural group.

Every.
    Every is also used for a plural group, but the word is used to describe the collective group, not the Individuals within it.

For Example:
    1. Each child is performing a different task. (Individual).
    2. Every child is performing the same task. (Collective group).

Test:
    1. SJ is using different pencils every time. = wrong.
        Correct:
            SJ is using different pencils each time.
        Because different different = Individual sense.
    2. SJ is using the same pencil each time. = Wrong.
        Collective sense = Every;
        Correct:
            SJ is using same pencil every time.
    3. Each artist is sensitive. Wrong.
        Sense = collective;
        Every = correct.
    4. Every artist sees things differently.
        Sense = Individual;
        Each = correct.
        Correct:
            Each artist sees things differently.
