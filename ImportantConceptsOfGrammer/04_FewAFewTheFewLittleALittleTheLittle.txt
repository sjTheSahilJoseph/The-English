Few and Little both means Little and Few.

Few = {
    Plural Countable Noun.
        For Example:
            Few boys,
            Few colleges,
            Few students,
            etc...
}

Little = {
    Uncountable Noun.
        For Example:
            Little water,
            Little work,
            Little milk,
            etc...
}

Basically Few denotes Number, and Little denotes Quantity.

Few, A few, The few = {
    Same meaning in the sense < something.
    And each of them will used to tell about numbers.
}

Few = Hardly any (Negative word).
    For Example:
        I read few books.

A few = Some (Positive word).
    For Example:
        I read a few books.
        
The few = Not many but all there are.
    For Example:
        I read the few books that I bought.

Little, A little, The little = {
    Same meaning in the sense < something.
    And each of them will used to tell about quantity.
}

Little = Hardly any (Negative word).
    For Example:
        I have little water.

A little = Some (Positive word).
    For Example:
        I have a little water.

The little = Not much but all there is.
    For Example:
        I gave the little water that I had.

NOTE:
    The little, The few = {
        There must be a clause after the place of The few or The little.
            For Example:
                She was so kind that she gave the few books she had to the needy person.
                    The few books... "She had" = Clause found.
                The little water that I had was split on the table.
                    The little water... "I had" = Clause found.
    }

Exception = {
    We can use "less" with "numbers" and "distance".
        For Example:
            I have 100$ less than what is required.
            In less than 7 days our results will be out.
    Less is the part of "little" = {
        Little, Less, Least
    }
    Less is the part of little but is is an exception.
    Less is used for numbers and distance.
    Only when the exact numbering is mentioned.
}

        rupees = number = few.
        few = negative word, but no use of few rupees if he needs some money.
        a few = correct because it makes sense.
    I gave him ___ money that I could spare then.
        money = uncountable/quantity = little.
        little = negative sense.
        a little = nope because (subject verb combination found after the place of little).
        the little = correct. as subject verb combination found directly after the place of little.
            I could = clause.
    No ___ than fifty students came for the hunger strike.
        exact numbers found (fifty) = less.
        Less = correct answer.
            By the way, No less than means at least.
    The doctor advised him to take rest for ___ days.
        days = numbers = few, a few, the few.
        few = negative = incorrect because some days are required at least.
        the few = no, because no subject verb combination is present directly after the place of few.
        a few = correct, because of the sense.
    She spent ___ amount of money she had.
        amount of money = uncountable = little, a little, the little.
        clause (she had) = found = the little.
