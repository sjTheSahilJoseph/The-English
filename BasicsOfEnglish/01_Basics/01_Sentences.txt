Kinds of Sentences.
    In English there are 4 kinds of Sentences.
    Most People say that There're 5 kinds of Sentences. But the 5th one is the type of 4th kind.
        Kinds of Sentences are:
        1. Assertive
        2. Interrogative
        3. Imperative
        4. Exclamatory

1. Assertive Sentence.
    Assertive Sentence is used to give information.
    Assert means You say something.
    Basically a simple Statement.
        There're 2 Categories of Assertive Sentence.
        1.1. Affirmative
        1.2. Negative

1.1. Affirmative Assertive Sentence.
    Positive Sentence, Like Yes Stuff.
    The Structure looks like this:
    Subject + Helping Verb + Main Verb + Object.
        For Example:
        SJ is going to London.

1.2. Negative Assertive Sentence.
    Negative Sentence, Like No Stuff.
    The Structure looks like this:
    Subject + Helping Verb + not + Main Verb + Object.
        For Example:
        SJ is not going to London.

2. Interrogative Sentence.
    Interrogative Sentence is used to ask Questions.
    Interrogative Sentence has 2 Categories, and those are:
        2.1. Direct Interrogative.
        2.2. Indirect Interrogative.

2.1. Direct Interrogative.
    Direct Interrogative are Sentence which are used to ask questions.
    Direct Questions.
        For Example:
        What is your name?
    Direct Interrogative is a sentence that is a direct question.
    It has 2 Categories, and those are:
        2.1.1. Yes/No Questions.
        2.1.2. Wh Questions.

2.1.1. Yes/No Questions.
    Yes/No Questions are the questions that their answer is in Yes or No.
    They starts with Helping Verb.
    The Structure is like:
    Helping Verb + Subject + Main Verb + Object?
        For Example:
        Are you going there? => Answer. yes/no.

2.1.2. Wh Questions.
    Wh Questions are the questions that their answers are quite detailed (non yes/no).
    They starts with Wh word.
    The Structure is like:
    Wh Word + Helping Verb + Subject + Main Verb + Object?
        For Example:
        Why are you going there? => Answer. Because of something...

2.1 Direct Interrogative Note:
    If yes/no questions and wh questions come together in a single sentence, in this case the first sentence will be in Interrogative form and the second sentence must be in Assertive form.
        For Example:
        May I know where are you going? => Wrong.
        "May I know" => Interrogative Form.
        "Where are you going?" => Should be in Assertive form.
        So the correct sentence is:
        May I know where you are going? => Right.
        "May I know" => Interrogative.
        "Where you are going?" => Assertive.
    But why this?
    Because when yes/no question and wh question come together in a single sentence, in this case the first sentence is asking but the second sentence is giving the information about the question.
        For Example: (2nd example)
        Could you tell me why did you not speak the truth? => Wrong.
        "Could you tell me why" => Interrogative.
        "Did you now speak the truth?" => Should be in Assertive form.
        So the correct sentence is:
        Could you tell me why you did not speak the truth? => Right.

2.1 Practice for Direct Interrogative Note:
        1. May I know why you do not talk to him? => Correct.
        2. May I know whom do you want to talk to? => Wrong.
            Why Wrong?
            Let's see if it is a single sentence of not.
                Yes It's a simple sentence.
            Is it a yes/no question with wh question?
                Yes. It is starting with yes/no question so we used Interrogative form, good.
            Is the second part is in Assertive form?
                Yes it is.
            But But But, We don't need to use do here.
            We just need to use you here.
            Because it is a simple sentence.
        The Corrected version is:
        May I know, whom you want to talk to? => Correct.
        3. Do you know when he shall be leaving for his higher studies in the U.S.A? => Correct.

2.1 Interrogative Sentence Useful Points.
    Anytime we see yes/no question with wh question in a single sentence. yes/no question should be in the first place. If we place wh question first then the Structure can never be right.
    And we have to place Assertive form with wh question.

2.2. Indirect Interrogative.
    Indirect Interrogative are Sentence which are not directly starting with a question but with a assertive sentence and then a question.
    Indirect Questions.
        For Example:
        I want to know what your name is.
            "I want to know" => Assertive.
            "What your name is" => Interrogative but not directly Interrogative but in Assertive Form.

2.2. Indirect Interrogative Note:
    Indirect Interrogative doesn't have anything to do with the Interrogative Structure.
    Neither Helping Verb comes before Subject nor question mark comes at the end of the sentence.
    The are simply in assertive form.
    At the end we have to put full stop (.).
    Who do we know that this sentence is Indirect Interrogative? It will begin with a simple assertive sentence.

2.2. Indirect Interrogative Sentence Examples.
    1. He cordially enquired how was my health. => Wrong.
        Because it is an Indirect Interrogative sentence, It starts with a simple assertive sentence and then question part, so it has nothing to do with Interrogative Structure.
        It means the subject will come first at "how was my health".
    The right one is:
        He cordially enquired how my health was. => Correct.
    2. I did not understand why did you not call me last night. => Wrong.
        Wrong because, It has nothing to do with Interrogative Structure.
        The subject should come before the helping verb.
    Right version:
        I did not understand why you did not call me last night. => Right.
    But why we added "did" here?
        Because of the "not" if the not is not present, then we don't have to add "did" here.
    3. Newton wanted to know why did the apple fall on the ground. => Wrong.
        This sentence is an Indirect Interrogative.
        But the thing is we don't have to put "did" here. Because of the rule of tenses.
        Second mistake here is we have to put 2nd form of verb "fell" not "fall".
    Right Version:
        Newton wanted to know why the apple fell on the ground. => Right.
    4. I asked him why did he call me a fool. => Wrong.
        We don't need to follow the Interrogative Structure here. I mean the subject should come first, and then remove the did because it is a simple sentence.
        We need to put 2nd form of verb here.
    Right Version:
        I asked him why he called me a fool. => Right.
    5. They could not tell me why did he call his father. => Wrong.
        Same mistake here, We have to put the subject first, and then the helping verb.
        Remove "did" form here. Because it is a simple sentence not negative or Interrogative stuff here.
        Not the 1st form of verb, but the 2nd form of verb.
    Right Version:
        They could not tell me why he called his father. => Right.
    6. Please explain me how did you solve this question. => Wrong.
        Remove "did".
        Subject first, then the helping verb.
    Right Version:
        Please explain me how you solved this question. => Right.
    7. The teacher asked the intruder who was he and why was he occupying his chair.
        Since it is an Indirect Interrogative.
        It has nothing to do with Direct Interrogative Structure.
        We have to put the subject first and then the helping verb.
        Yes it has 2 wh questions. But then also, They are simple assertive sentences.
    Right Version:
        The teacher asked the intruder who he was and why he was occupying his chair.
    
3. Imperative Sentence.
    Imperative Sentence is used to express Order, Advice, Request.
        Structure:
            They starts with:
                Verb 1st form, Do, Do not, Let.
    Quick Question:
        Difference Between Advise & Advice.
            Advise = Verb.
            Advice = Noun.
    For Example:
        1. Work hard. => Starts with Verb 1st form.
        2. Do work hard. => Starts with Do.
        3. Do not talk to her. => Starts with Do not.
        4. Please, Finish the work. => Starts with Finish. => Verb 1st form. ("Please" is just for modifying). But the actual Imperative sentence is starting with Finish.
        5. Let me go. => Stats with Let.

4. Exclamatory Sentence.
    The word Exclamatory is made up from word "Exclaim".
    They are use to express strong feelings, Emotions, Reactions.
        Structure:
            They starts with What/How.
            or They can also starts with Interjection - Hurrah! Wow! stuff.
            (Interjections are the words that tells the strong feeling).
        For Example:
            What a movie!
            Hurrah! I dot selected for the job.
    Exclamatory Sentence have a 2nd part and that is Optative Sentence:

4.1 Optative Sentence.
    Optative Sentence are use to express Blessing, Curse, Wish.
        Structure:
            May + Subject + Verb 1st form! (!).
            or
            May + Subject + Verb 1st form. (.).
        For Example:
            May God bless you!
            May you rot in hell!
        We can add ! or . at the end of Optative Sentence, Totally up to us.
        We can drop the May, It is also optional.
            For Example:
                You rot in hell!
            The sense is same.
