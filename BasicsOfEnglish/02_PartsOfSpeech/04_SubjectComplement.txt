What is Subject Complement?
    First of all we know the word "Compliment". It means praising.
    But here, its not Compliment but Complement.
    So what is Complement?
        The word Complement made up from word "Complete".
    Subject Complement completes the Subject.

Concept of Subject Complement.
    In previous chapter, we learnt about Objects.
        In order to identify the object of verb, we have to see if the condition is returning true or false.
        Which condition?
            After the verb, if we are getting the reply of what or whom, only then it'll be the object of verb.
    But in English language, there are a lot of verbs which doesn't denotes action.
        Those verbs works as linking the verb to the subject.
        Those verbs just tells the state of subject.
        These type of verbs are called Linking Verbs.
    After Linking Verbs we use Subject Complement.
    Summary: Linking verbs are used to tell the state of the subject. Linking verbs just tells the state of subject not the action of anything.

Some Linking Verbs:
    There are many linking verbs but these are some famous ones.
        1. Look 
        2. Sound 
        3. Smell 
        4. Feel 
        5. Taste 
        6. Appear 
        7. Seem 
        8. Get 
        9. Grow 
        10. Remain 
        11. Become 
        12. Be (main verb) 

After Linking verbs, there is no object present.
    Because the just link with Subject Complement.

Subject Complement will be always the:
    Noun / Pronoun / Adjective.

Subject will be the same as Subject Complement.
    They must be the same person.

Note:
    2 words in a sentence can never be subject complement.

Subject Complement Examples:
    1. I am a teacher.
        What is the verb here?
            Am.
        Is that helping verb or main verb?
            Main verb.
        Why Main main?
            Because if in sentence, there is no main verb present, then the helping verb will work as the main verb.
        Let's find the subject Complement here:
            Am is the verb.
            Am is the form of Be. (As mentioned previously in some linking verbs.)
            The sentence:
                I am a teacher.
                    I = subject.
                    am = verb.
                        Linking Verb.
                            Because it is link the subject to the subject Complement.
                    a teacher. = subject Complement.
                        Because, The subject and the subject Complement are the same.
                        The subject Complement must be the noun / pronoun / Adjective.
                            It is the noun.
                                Because teacher is the name.
                                Article is present before the noun.
            A Teacher is the Subject Complement here.
    2. We are friends.
        Are = form of Be.
        Are is the working as main verb here.
            Because there is no other verb present.
        When the form of Be works as main verb, we also call it Linking verb.
        Word After the linking verb, cannot be the object of verb.
        It always be the subject Complement.
        So in this case friends is the subject Complement.
            It must be the noun / pronoun / Adjective.
                It is noun.
            Subject and subject Complement must be the same.
                Yes, They are the same.
                Who are friends?
                    We.
                Who we are?
                    friends.
                So they are the same.
    3. She is beautiful.
        is is working as main form of verb. It is the form of Be.
        When the form of Be works as Main verb, we also call it the Linking Verb.
        The word after linking verb, is not object right? It is the subject Complement.
        And the subject complement is must be the noun / pronoun / adjective.
            It is the adjective.
        Since beautiful is the subject complement.
        Which subject? She.
        She is pronoun.
        Subject and subject complement is same. 
            yes.
    4. Sugar tastes sweet.
        Sweet is the subject complement.
    5. She seems lucky.
        Seems is the verb.
            Seems is the 5th form of verb.
            Seems is working here as main verb.
                Because no more verb is present.
            Seems is working as linking verb here.
        After the linking verb, we are linking the lucky.
        Lucky is the adjective.
        She is the pronoun.
        Who seems lucky?
            She.
        She seems what?
            Lucky.
        They are same. So seems is the subject complement.
    6. She is a beautiful girl.
        What is the subject complement here? Beautiful or Girl?
            Let's figure out.
        In this sentence, the word "is", is that the form of Be?
            Yes.
        Is the form of Be (is) working as the main verb?
            Yes, it is. Because after is there is no other verb is present. So it has to work as main verb.
        Is that is is working as Linking Verb?
            Yes. Whenever the form of Be is working as main verb, we can also call it a linking verb.
        When we talk about this sentence, there are 2 words after the linking verb.
            Beautiful and Girl.
            Let's check their part of speech.
                Beautiful = Adjective.
                Girl = Noun.
            The article "a" is for the girl.
            Because the beautiful is the adjective for girl.
        We know that in order ot be subject complement, the word must be a noun / pronoun / adjective.
        So how can we tell that which word is Subject complement?
            2 words in a sentence can never be subject complement.
        She is a beautiful. => Wrong sentence.
            It means the adjective is just confusing us. The real subject complement is Girl. Not Beautiful.
        She is a girl. => Right.
            Now we got it. We can make a right sentence without adjective. So girl is the subject complement.
        In this sentence the subject complement is "Girl" not beautiful Because, beautiful is just modifying the Girl.
    7. It was they who were running fast.
        What is the verb?
            Was.
                Was is the form of verb Be.
                Was is working as main verb here.
                    It is also a Linking Verb.
        After the linking verb, the word is subject complement.
            It was they...
                So they is the subject complement.
        In order to become subject complement, the word must be a noun / pronoun / adjective.
            They is the pronoun.
        In order to become subject complement, the subject and the subject complement must be the same.
            And yes, They are same.
                It was who?
                    They.
                They are what?
                    It.
    8. It is I who am responsible for the lose.
        What is the verb here?
            Is.
                Is is the form of Be.
            Is is working as the main verb here.
                So it is also a linking verb.
        The word after linking verb, is the subject complement.
            I is the subject complement.
                I is pronoun.
        Subject and Subject complement should be the same.
            Yes they are.

Subject Complement are not as objects.
  Sometimes we have a doubt that what is the object and what is the subject complement.
  We have to understand that Subject Complement are not as objects.
  If any sentence have subject and the object. It can never be the same.
  But if any sentence have subject and subject complement, then they must be the same. Always.
  Take a look at these sentences:
    1. He married a writer.
    2. He became a writer.
        They both have the verb.
            1. He married a writer. (married = verb).
            2. He became a writer. (became = verb).
        But the sentence no. 1 have object and sentence no. 2 have subject complement.
    1. He married a writer.
        He and writer is not the same.
            When we get the reply of whom of what in a sentence after verb, it is the object of verb.
                He married what?
                    Error.
                He married whom?
                    A Writer.
                        A writer = Article.
                        A writer = Noun.
                            So it is the object of verb.
    2. He became a writer.
        Is and writer is same.
            When the subject and the subject complement are same, it is called subject complement.
                Subject complement must be the noun / pronoun / adjective.
                    a writer = noun (article within it).
                    write = name
                So we confirmed that this is the subject complement.
