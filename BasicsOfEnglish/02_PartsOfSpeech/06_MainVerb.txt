Main Verb has 2 Categories:
    1. Finite Verbs.
    2. Non Finite Verbs.

First take a look at these sentences:
    1. I went to watch a movie.
        I = subject.
        Went = Verb.
        to =  preposition.
        watch = verb.
        a movie = object.
        yesterday = adverb.
    2. He has gone to watch a movie.
        he = subject.
        has gone = verb (main + helping)
        to = preposition.
        watch = verb.
        a = article.
        movie = object.
    3. They have gone to watch a movie.
        they = subject.
        have gone = verb (helping + main).
        to = preposition.
        watch = verb.
        a movie = object.
    4. They will go to watch a movie tomorrow.
        They = subject.
        will go = verb (main + helping).
        to = preposition.
        watch = verb.
        a movie = object.
        tomorrow = adverb.
    Notice something that, The watch is also a verb but it is not changing due to the rules of tenses and the subject person or persons. I mean singular or plural. It is not changing its form.
    And Go, Went, Gone, Go,, These are changing its form based on the rules of tenses, number of persons (subject = singular or plural).
    The verbs that change based on rules of tenses and number of persons are basically finite verbs.
    The verbs that don't change based on rules of tenses and number of persons are basically non-finite verbs.

Finite Verbs.
    Finite means "bound" - finite verbs must agree with the number and person of its subject.
    Basically it is follow verb, It follow by tense and the number of persons.

Non Finite Verbs.
    Unlike Finite verbs, non-finite verbs are not bound by tense and number or person of subject.
    Basically it is non-follow verb, It don't follow by tense and the number of persons.

Non Finite Verbs has 3 Categories:
    1. Infinitive
    2. Gerund
    3. Participle

Infinitive.
    Infinitive is basically form of Verb we call it (To + Verb 1st Form).
        Whenever we see (to + verb 1st form) this pair is called Infinitive.
    What Infinitive can do in English language?
        It can be a subject.
    For Example:
        1. To walk is a good exercise.
            Verb = is.            
                Form of Be. As main Verb.
            If there is a verb, there is a subject.
                subject = (to walk).
                    Infinitive.
                        Verb As subject.
        2. To swim is good for health.
            Verb = Is.
                Main verb.
                Form of Be.
                Also we can call it linking verb.
                good = subject complement.
                for = preposition.
                health = object of preposition.
            To swim = subject.
                But swim is the verb but here it is used as subject.
                with to.
                It is Infinitive.
    Infinitive can also become Object.
        For Example:
            1. I want to go.
                verb = want.
                subject = I.
                object = to go.
                    I want what?
                        I want to go.
                    Object of verb.
                Infinitive = To go.
            2. I want to speak.
                I = subject.
                want = verb.
                to speak = Infinitive.
                    object = to speak.
                        I want what?
                            To speak.
                                Object of verb.
            3. She loves to play.
                She = subject.
                loves = verb.
                to play = Infinitive.
                    Object of verb.
                        she loves what?
                            to play.
                            Object of verb.

Gerund.
    Gerund = (Verb 1st form + ing).
        But wait a minute, quite confusing right?
            Verb 1st form + ing should be verb right?
                But why this is called gerund?
        When, (Verb 1st form + ing) works as noun, then its called Gerund.
    For Example:
        1. Walking is a good exercise.
            Verb = is.
            Walking = Verb 1st form + ing but working as noun here, so its gerund.
                It is working as Noun.
                    Because it has to become subject. Because where there is a verb, there is a subject.
        2. Swimming is good for health.
            main verb = is;
            subject = Swimming;
                Gerund.
        3. Teaching is a good profession.
            Main verb = is;
            Teaching = gerund.
                working as noun but its a verb. But here it is working as noun.
                    subject.
    Gerund can also become object.
    For Example:
        1. SJ likes dancing.
            dancing = object.
                (verb 1st + ing) is gerund.
                SJ likes what?
                    dancing.
                        Object of Verb.
            main verb = likes.
        2. I enjoyed drinking.
            enjoyed = verb.
            I = subject.
            drinking = object.
                (Verb 1st form + ing) is gerund.
    Some Points of Gerund:
        We know that when verb 1st form + ing works as noun then we call it gerund.
            it can be subject or object.
        After the preposition, the gerund can be present. It is totally valid.
            For Example:
                She is good at swim. => Wrong.
                    at = preposition.
                        After the preposition, the object of preposition is present.
                            Object can only be a noun or a pronoun.
                            So we need to make it a noun or a pronoun.
                            By adding a ing after the first form.
                She is good at Swimming. = Right.
                I am sorry for tell you all this. => Wrong.
                I am sorry for telling you all this. => Right.
                I am tired of argue. => Wrong.
                I am tired of arguing. => Right.
            We must make noun/pronoun by adding + ing.

Participle.
    Participle has 3 Categories:
        1. Present Participle.
            Verb 1st form + ing.
        2. Past Participle.
            Verb 3rd form.
        3. Perfect Participle.
            having + verb 3rd form, after + ving.
    What is the difference between Gerund and Participle?
        Gerund:
            Gerund is (verb 1st form + ing) works as noun.
        Participle:
            Participle works as Verb or Adjective.
    For Example:
        1. A horse is running.
            Helping Verb = is;
            Main verb = Running;
                Notice:
                    Here, (Verb 1st form + ing) is working as Verb. So it is the Participle.
                        Present Participle.
        2. I saw a running house.
            Verb = Saw;
            What is object of verb?
                I saw what?
                    Horse.
                Horse = object of verb.
            running = Adjective.
                (verb 1st form + ing) working as Participle here.
                    Present Participle.
        3. She has written a letter.
            Verb = has written.
                written = 3rd form of verb.
                    Participle.
                        Past Participle.
        4. Police wanted a written statement.
            wanted = main verb.
            Adjective = written.
                Participle.
        5. Running is good for health.
            Here running is gerund.
