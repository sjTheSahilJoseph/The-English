Beyond, Across

Beyond
-> Ke paar
-> Ke agay
-> Jo dikh na raha ho uske bad
-> Jise chu ya dekh nhi skte (abstraction)




There is a temple beyond this mountain.
// jo hme dikh nhi rha

What is beyond that river?

There is nothing beyond life.
// abstraction

There are things beyond our imagination.

There was a forest beyond it.

There is nothing beyond love.



Across
-> Ke paar
-> Ke agay
-> Kisi cheez, ya kisi jgah ke paar/agay.
-> Jo dikh raha hai




I can swim across the river.

My home is across the road.

He is standing across the road.
