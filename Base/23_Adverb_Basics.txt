Adverb
Adverbs are the words or clauses (group of words) that show the quality of
verb/adjective or another adjective.
Or provide some additional information about them.

For example:
SJ runs fast.
-> runs = verb
-> fast = adverb
SJ runs slow.
-> slow = adverb
-> runs = verb
He is a very good boy.
-> is = main verb // because no main verb is there
-> very = adverb
-> good = adjective
SJ runs very fast.
-> runs = verb
-> very = adverb
-> fast adverb
SJ runs fast, that is good.
-> runs = verb
-> fast = adverb
-> "that is good" = adverb // clause

There are 3 degrees of adverb:
1. Positive
2. Comparative
3. Superlative

1. Positive = simple
Like:
SJ runs fast.
SJ runs ver fast.
etc...

2. Comparative = compared to something or someone.
(than)
Like:
SJ runs faster than me.

3. Superlative = super level
(the)
Like:
SJ runs the fastest.

// We usually add "er" with comparative and "est" with superlative.
// But exceptions are always there.
// We can see different patterns.
// Same as adjectives.
// // "more" with comparative and "most" with superlative.

Some Examples:
Fast Faster Fastest
Slow Slower Slowest
Late Later Last
Up Upper Uppermost // same concept from adjectives
Out Outer Outermost
I'll come afterwards. // bad me -> adverb
That girl will go again. // again -> adverb
I have already told you. // already -> adverb
You can't go away. // away -> adverb
I got up early today. // early -> adverb
He is just coming. // just -> adverb
I sleep late at night. // late -> adverb
He hardly comes here. // hardly -> adverb
She rarely goes there. // rarely -> adverb
We work together. // together -> adverb
He came here once. // once -> adverb
He seldom bites. // seldom -> adverb
They are going afar. // afar -> adverb
I often call you. // often -> adverb

One Word = Adjective && Adverb
Like:
Enough
I have enough pens. // enough = adjective
I prepared enough. // enough = adverb

Interesting fact:
Word + ly = Adjective
(in most cases)

For example:
SJ is nice. // Adjective
SJ created nicely. // Adverb
You are quick. // Adjective
He works quickly. // Adverb
