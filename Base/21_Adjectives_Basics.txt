Adjectives

Adjectives are the words or the clauses that show the quality of
noun/pronoun or provide some additional information about them.

For example:
SJ is brave.
-> Brave = Adjective
SJ is coward.
-> Coward = Adjective
He is handsome.
-> Handsome = Adjective
I have many pencils.
-> Many = Adjective
You have few pencils.
-> Few = Adjective
SJ is my brother who plays with you.
-> "Who playes with you" = Adjective Clause
He is SJ who is older/elder than I.
-> "Who is older/elder than I" = Adjective Clause
// Elder = If original brother.
// Older = Cousin, Friend or something like that.

There are 3 degrees of Adjectives:
1. Positive
2. Comparative (than)
3. Superlative (the)

User of "er/est":
Comparative Degree: "er"
Superlative Degree: "est"

For example:
Tall Taller Tallest
Short Shorter Shortest

Basic Concept:
If Simple:
-> He is young.
If compare (than):
-> Comparative Degree
-> He is younger than me.
If form all (the):
-> Superlative Degree
-> He is the youngest.

// Old / Young / Elder
Young Younger Youngest
// Generall
Old Older Oldest
// If not in relation
Old Elder Elderest
// If in relation


Also:
When using "elder/younger" use "than" Preposition.
When using "younger" use "to" Preposition.

For example:
SJ is younger to me.
SJ is elder than I.
Ajay is older than I.

SJ is the youngest brother.
SJ is the elderest brother.
He is the oldest in class.

// Non-Er-Est Adjectives

We generally use "er" with comparative degree and "est" with superlative degree.
But this is not valid for all adjectives. Some use "more" for comparative and
"most" for superlative degree.

For example:
Active More Active Most Active

// Irregular Adjectives
Irregular Adjectives means they don't follow a specific pattern.

For example:
Good/Well Better Best
Bad/Ill Worse Worst
Must/Many More Most
Little Less/Lesser Least
