Types of Noun:

Subjective Pronouns
A subjective pronoun acts as the subject of a sentence.
It performs the action of the verb.

For example:
<He> is good.
<We> are good.
<They> are good.

Some Subjective Pronouns:
I, We, You, They, He, She, etc...

Objective Pronouns
An objective pronoun acts as the object of a sentence.
It recieves the action of the verb.

For example:
SJ was with <me>.
They are watching <you>.
He scolded <him>.

Some Subjective Pronouns:
Me, Him, You, Her, Them, Us, etc...

Possessive Pronouns
A possessive pronoun tells us, who owns a particular thing.

For example:
You are <my> son.
She is <your> sister.
This book is <mine>.
This pen is <hers>.

Some Possissive Pronouns:
My, Mine, His, Her, Hers, Your, Yours, Their, Theirs, Our, Ours.

Difference in usage of possissive pronouns:
My - Mine
Our - Ours
Your - Yours
His - #same His
Her - Hers
Their - Theirs

Basically if nothing is connected with possession in sentence, we use 2nd type.
Like:
This is mine.
But if something is connected, then we use 1st type.
Like:
This is my book.

And also, if we have to emphasise on the thing, then we use 2nd type.
Like:
This book is mine.
If we have to emphasise on owner, then 1st type.
This is my book.

Reflexive Pronouns
A reflexive pronoun refers back to the subject of the sentence.

For example:
He'll do it <himself>.
I'll do it <myself>.
You'll do it <yourself> / <yourselves>.
    // If one person then yourself, if more than one then yourselves.


Some reflexive pronouns:
Yourself, Yourselves, Herself, Himself, Myself, Themselves, Ourselves, etc...

Intensive Pronouns
An intenseive pronoun emphasizes its antecedent noun or pronoun.

For example:
I <myself> should try.
SJ <himself> will go.
You <yourself> will go.

Indefinite Pronouns
An indefinite pronoun refers to an indefinite / general person or thing.

For example:
All, Both, Each, Few, Everyone, Many, Some, None, etc...
<All> are working.
<Few> are sitting.
<None> is studying.
<Many> are playing.
<Both> are with me.

// Here we aren't telling the exact number, just refering generally.

Demonstrative Pronouns

For example:
<This> is my pen.
<That> is your book.
<These> are his pens.
<Those> are enemies.
