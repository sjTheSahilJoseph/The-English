Apostrophe S
('s)

We use apostrophe ('s) to express relation/possession.

For Example:
	SJ's computer.

When we say:
	SJ's computer.
    	We give importance to SJ than his computer.
    &
    The computer of SJ.
    	Here we give importance to SJ's computer than SJ.


For example:
	I need SJ's laptop.
    	(not anyone else but SJ's)
    I need laptop of SJ.
    	(not anything else only a laptop)


The concept of 's & s'
	When there is a singular noun, and already s is present,
    we don't put another ('s) after s plural word.
    We simply use ' after the s.
    	For Example:
        	Jeans, Trousers, etc...
            -> Jeans', Trousers', etc...
     More examples:
     	Girl's -> Singular
        Girls' -> Plural
        
		Girl's pen.
        	One girl, one pen.
        Girls' pens.
        	Many girls, many pens.
        Girls' pen.
        	One pen, many girls.
