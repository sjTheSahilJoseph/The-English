Articles
There are 3 Articles:
1. A
2. An
3. The

1. A (Ae)
A means one.
For example:
This is a pen.


There are 2 types of articles:
1. Definite Article [The]
2. Indefinite Articles [An, A]

1. Definite Article [The]
It generally points out a particular person, place, or thing.

2. Indefinite Articles [An/A]
It generally doesn't point out any particular person, place, or thing.
We use indefinite articles when we don't have information before that about the thing.

Basically when we don't have information before = A boy
When we have information before = The boy

This is the book, I was talking about. = Definite Article
This is a book. = Indefinite Article

Also, we use A, An for "koi"/"aek".

Like:
Mr. SJ is at the door. = We know the information. (Mr. SJ door pe hain)
A Mr. SJ is at the door. = When we tell someone first time. (Koi Mr.Sj door pe hain)
// Generally before name, we don't put any article, but in that case, we do.

A vs An:
Vowels = A, E, I, O, U
Consonants = B, C, D, ... except vowels.

An:
When next word starts with vowel sound. (not only vowel, but also vowel sound).
For example:
Aeroplane, Apple, Elephant, M.L.A (Am, Al, Ley), An Hour (Hour = Vowel sound -> Aavar),
An Honest (Vowel sound), An ear (vowel sound), An orange (vowel sound), etc...

A:
When next word starts with consonant sound.
For example:
A University (University = Vowel but it's sound isn't vowel in this case),
A boy, A pen, A year (consonant sound), A union (consonent sound), etc...


Where to pronounce "The" and where to pronounce "Thee".
Thee:
If next word starts with vowel sound.
The:
If next word starts with consonant sound.

For example:
The boy -> The
The pen -> The
The year -> The
The ear -> Thee
The honest -> Thee
The orange -> Thee
The elephant -> Thee
The end -> Thee
etc...

Where to use The:
With unique people or objects.
For example:
The Sun, The Moon, The Earth, The President, The CEO, The world, The sky, etc...
With adjectives reffering to a whole group of people.
For example:
The old, The rich, The young, The poor, etc...

With ordinal numbers.

With country names but only for which include "state, kingdom, republic etc..."
Otherwise, we don't use "the" with country names.
