Gerund

Verb + ing = Gerund
// Generally

Basically, we use verb's name as noun in the sentence.
Like, if we want to say something about "playing", we treat
"playing" as noun, not as verb.
For example:
Playing is good for health.
// Playing is noun here. (Gerund)
// is = verb.

Before continue, understand that:
In a sentence, Subject is either a noun or a pronoun.

Gerund

Examples:
Reading is a good habbit.
// Here "reading" is treated as gerun (noun) not as verb.
// But we can't use "Read" here, Like "Read is a good habbit".
// Because we have to convert it into a gerund to use it as subject.
// We simply use ing form of verb and we use that gerund as subject.
// This is called gerund. Basically that word is now a gerund.

If a verb is added with "ing" and used as a noun in a sentence, that verb
is called "Gerund".


Examples:
Running is good for health.
Gyming is my routine.
Playing guitar is my love.
Loving you is my habit.
Smoking is injurious to health.
Speaking is important.
etc...
