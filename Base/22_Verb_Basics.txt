Verb
Verb describes the action or the state of the subject.

Verb tells more than that, it tells weather the verb is in present,
or in past, or in future. And in which state.

For example:
SJ is playing.
-> "Playing" = Verb
-> "is" = Verb
-> "is playing" = single verb because one subject can only have one main verb.
-> So we combile helping verb and main verb to make one verb.
SJ is 8 years old.
-> "is" = Verb // present
SJ was 11 years old.
-> "was" = Verb // past
SJ will be 8 years old.
-> "will be" = Verb // future
// Basically verb tells the time of state or action as well.

Verb has 2 types:
1. Main verb
2. Helping/Auxilary Verb

1. Main Verb
Main verb describes the action of the subject.

For example:
Write, Play, Think, Sit, Stand, Drink, Miss, Love, etc...

2. Helping/Auxilary Verb
Helping verb describes the state of the subject.
(Present/Past/Future)

Present Helping Verbs:
Is, Am, Are, Has, Have, Has been, Have been, Do, Does, Can,
Should, Must, etc..
// Can, should, must, etc... are modal helping verbs, we'll take a brief look later on.

Past Helping Verbs:
Was, Were, Did, Had, Had been, Could, Could have, Should have, Must have, etc...
// Could, Could have, Should have, Must have, etc... are modal helping verbs,
we'll take a brief look later.

Future Helping Verbs:
Will, Will have, Will have to, etc...
// Will have to, etc... is modal helping verb, we'll see in details later.

Practice:
I'm playing piano.
-> "am" = present // helping verb
-> "playing" = continous // main verb
I was playing piano.
-> "was" = past // helping verb
-> "playing" = continous // main verb
He is weak.
-> "is" = present // main verb // when no main verb is present, auxiliary verb becomes main verb.
