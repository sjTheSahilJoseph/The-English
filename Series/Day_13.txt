There is a category of sentences where subject is present, verb can or can't be present, but the subject is not doing anything directly or nothing is happening on the subject directly.
These are called Simple Sentences, where Tenses not apply. Because when Action Verbs is done by subject, or on subject, then it's tense, otherwise it's simple sentence.

In 95% Cases, we use Verb's 3rd form in these simple sentences.
For Example:
    That window is broken.
        Verb {Break, Broke, Broken}.
        Broken -> 3rd form.
    These speices are ground.
        Verb {Grind, Ground, Ground}.
        Ground -> 3rd form.
    A page of my book is torn.
        Verb {Tear, Tore, Torn}.
        Subject?
            Subject is whole "A page of my book". Not only "a page" But whole thing is subject.
        Torn -> 3rd form.
    This rope is tied.
        Verb {Tie, Tied, Tied}.
        Tied -> 3rd form.
    This stick is bent.
        Verb {Bend, Bent, Bent}.
        Bent -> 3rd form.
    I'm scared of this thing.
        Verb {Scare, Scared, Scared}.
        Scared -> 3rd form.
        NOTE: (With scared, we use preposition "of").
            For Example:
                I'm scared of you.
                I'm scared of failure.

    Something is kept there. / Something is kept over there.
        Where we see, "there" as objective part, we can use "over" with it. Totally Optional.
        Verb {Keep, Kept, Kept}.
    He is hidden behind the wall.
        Verb {Hide, Hid, Hidden}.
        In some cases, we don't use verb 3rd form but verb+ing form.
            For Example:

        Verb {Stop, Stopped, Stopped}.
    Clothes are hung on the nail.
        Verb {Hang, Hung, Hung}.
        NOTE: Hang also means Hang neck with ropes (Death).
            In that case, the form of verbs will be:
                Verb {Hang, Hanged, Hanged}.

        Verb {Tire, Tired, Tired}.
