Sentence = Subject + Verb + Objective Part.
    Subject = Noun.
        Noun = Name of anything.
            Noun can be singular or plural.
                Singular Noun = SJ, I, He, She, It, Pen, Man, etc...
                Plural Noun = SJ and JS, They, We, Pens, Men, etc...
    Subject = Pronoun.
        Pronoun = Replace Noun.
            Pronoun works on Person Table.
                Person = 1st Person:
                    Singular = I
                    Plural = We
                Person = 2nd Person:
                    Singular = None but we use You for Singular as well.
                    Plural = You
                Person = 3rd Person:
                    Singular = He, She, This, That, It Singular Noun
                    Plural = They, These, Those, Plural Noun
                Some Points:
                    We use This for Near and That for Far.
                    We can replace this with it when this is alone in a Subject.
                        For Example:
                            This is my friend. -> It is my friend.
                    But we cannot replace when This is not alone in subject.
                        For Example:
                            It book is very nice. = Wrong.
                            This book is very nice. = Right.
    Subject = Gerund.
        Gerund = Verb + ing.
            For Example:
                Read + ing is a good habit. = Correct.
                    Now the reading is the subject not verb. It is using as subject (Noun).
    Subject + Infinitive.
        Infinitive = to + verb.
            For Example:
                He likes to read.
                    Now the "to read" is not verb here, But we are using the reference here.
        To read is a good habit.
        Both are good.
        These are noun.
    Verb = Main Verbs, Helping Verbs.
        Main Verbs = Action Verbs.
            Action Verbs = Which shows an action.
                For Example:
                    Think, Miss, Play, Eat, Drink, Teach, etc...
        Helping verbs = Primary Helping Verbs, Modal Verbs, Semi Modal Verbs.
            Helping Verbs used to tell the state of the work.
            Primary Helping Verbs = Be, Do, Have.
                Be = Is, Am, Are, Was, Were, Will Be.
                    Present = Is Am Are
