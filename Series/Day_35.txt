NOTE.
When we make these sentences using "should" we don't care about the person.
But when we make these sentences using "has/have/had + to + have" then we have to be very careful.
We use "has" with 3rd person singular subject only.
We use "have" for the rest.
We use "had" for both but in past context.

Negative.
We don't use this formation for negatives.
We mosly use "should have" formation for negatives.

NOTE.
We use "Should", "Must", "Ought to" for "Chahiye".

-> We use "must" when the task is super important.
-> We use "ought to" when the condition is ideal.
