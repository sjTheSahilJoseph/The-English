Tenses in English.

Any sentenc in English is in a specific time.
Time has 3 categories:
    1. Present
    2. Past
    3. Future

NOTE:
    Their values are strict. I mean past means even 1 sec before the preset. And Present means only this moment. Same with future, even 1 sec after preset (now) is future.

No matter which time. There are 2 senerios:
    1. In each time, there can be 2 types of setences.
        1. Simple sentence
        2. Tense.
        
        1. Simple Sentense:
            (Subject -> Verb) -> Action is optional.
        2. Tense.
            Subject -> Verb) -> Action is must.

What are Tenses?
    A set of verb form.
        What is Verb?
            The Action Word.
        When any action happens, we need to know the time of that action. Right?
            Like, Is that action happened in past? future? or in the present?
    Tense is the part of verb that tells the time of that action, like, when the action happened or will happen.
    But how?
        In order to know the time of that action, we change the form of verb.
    Forms of Verb:
        There are total 5 forms of verb:
            1. Verb 1st form = play;
            2. Verb 2nd form = played;
            3. Verb 3rd form = played;
            4. Verb 4th form (ing) = playing;
            5. Verb 5th form (s/es) = plays;
    For Example:
        1. SJ plays hockey. (Present)
        2. SJ played hockey. (Past)
        3. SJ will play hockey. (Future)
            Did you see? The difference?
            I used different form of verb to tell the time of the same action. But by changing the form of verb, the whole time changed of that action.

Primary Helping Verbs + Main Verbs = Tenses.
Modals Helping Verb + Main Verbs = Modals.

Simple Sentence is where the subject is not doing any work.
    For Example:
        The window is broken. => Simple Sentense. Because Window is the subject. And broken is verb but subject (window) is not doing anything.
        (Mere papa soye hue hain.) -> My father is sleeping. => This is telling the state. So this is not a tense, but a simple sentence.
        (Woh ladka car me baitha hua tha). -> Simple sentence. (State).


Tense Sentece is where the subject is doing some kind of action.
    For Example:
        You broke the window. => Tense. Now the subject (you (second person singular) did something. (action).
        (Mere papa so rahe hain.) -> My father is sleeping. => This is also a tense, because sleeping is also an action.
        (Who ladka car me baith raha tha). -> Tense. (Action).
