Semi Modal Verbs
Dare and Need


Why we call semi modal verbs?
    Because sometimes we use these (dare & need) as modal verb.
    And sometimes as main verb.

Dare (Himmat).
    -> Main verb (to).
        -> Present, Past & Future (Never in Continuous Tense)
    -> Modal verb (to -> wrong).
        -> Only Present (only in negative, only in Interrogative).
Need (Zarurat).
    -> Main verb (to).
        -> Present, Past & Future (Never in Continuous Tense)
    -> Modal verb (to -> wrong).
        -> Only Present (only in negative, only in Interrogative).

Practice.
Woh wahan jane ki himmat krta hai.
    He dares to go there.
Woh wahan jane ki himmat nhi krta hai.
    He does not dare to go there.
Kia woh wahan jane ki himmat krta hai?
    Does he dare to go there?
Kia woh wahan jane ki himmat nhi krta hai?
    Does he not dare to go there?
    Doesn't he dare to go there?

// We cannot make positive sentences with them as modal verb.

Practice.
Woh wahan jane ki himmat nhi karta hai.
    He dare not go there.

// As are working with modal verb, we don't apply tenses rules here.
    -> person stuff.

Kia woh wahan jane ki himmat krta hai?
    Dare he go there?
Kia woh wahan jane ki nhi krta hai?
    Dare he not go there?
Woh wahan jane ki himmat kiu krta hai?
    Why does he dare to go there?
    Why dare he go there?
Apki himmat kese hui?
    How dare you?
Apki yahan ane ki himmat kese hui?
    How dare you come here?

// Continuous Tense case.

Practice.
Woh wahan jane ki himmat kr raha hai.
    He is daring to go there. -> Wrong.
    He dares to go there.
    // We cannot use "ing" with "dare" ever. We have to say in present indefinite in that case.

// We can use in perfect tenses, but not even in perfect continuous.

Practice.
Usne yeh faisla krne ki himmat ki hai.
    He has dared to take this decision.
Usne yeh faisla krne ki himmat nhi ki hai.
    He has not dared to take this decision.

    Has he dared to take this decision?
Kia usne yeh failsa krne ki himmat nhi ki hai?
    Has he not dared to take this decision?


// In modal verbs, there is nothing called perfect tense.

// Past Context.

Usne mujhe gali deni ki himmat ki.
    He dared to abuse me.
    // we use 2nd form of verb for past indefinite.
Usne mujhe gali dene ki himmat nhi ki.
    He did not dare to abouse me.
Kia usne mujhe gali dene ki himmat ki?
    Did he dare to abuse me?
Kia usne mujhe gali dene ki himmat nhi ki?
    Did he not dare to abuse me?
Usne mujhe gali dene ki himmat kiu ki?
    Why did he dare to abuse me?
Usne mujhe gali dene ki himmat kese ki?
    How did he dare to abuse me?
Usne mujhe gali dene ki himmat kiu nhi ki?
    Why did he not dare to abuse me?

// we cant make these using dare as modal verb, because we can only make for present not other.

// Past Perfect.
Usne usdin waha jane ki himmat ki thi.
    He had dared to go there that day.
Usne usdin whaa jane ki himmat nhi ki thi.
    He had not dared to go there that day.

    Had he dared to go there that day?

// We don't use semi modal verbs in continuous tense or in perfect continuouse as well.

Like
I'm needing to go there.
    -> complete wrong.
But we say "He is a daring person".
Why?
    Because now "daring" is not working as verb, but as adjective.
    In this case the main verb is "is".
        -> Basically present participle.

In this sentence.
Mai waha jana chah raha hoon.
    I'm wanting to go there. -> wrong.
    I want to go there. -> correct.

More Practice.
Usne kisi trah andr jane ki himmat ki.
    He somehow dared to go in.
Use yeh baat mujhe btane ki zarurat nhi hai.
    He doesn't need to tell me about it.
    He doesn't need to tell me about this matter.
    He need not tell me about it.
    He need not tell me about this matter.
