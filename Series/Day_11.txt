Identify Subject.
Mai soch raha hu. -> Mai (I). [I = first person singular.]. [I -> Am as auxilary verb.].
Wo soch raha hai. -> Wo (He). (He because of (raha hai) = male).
Mai or Woh kuch soch rahe hain. -> (Mai or Woh) -> Subject. [Plural Subject]. [I and he]. [Are have do were = auxilary verb].

NOTE: When learning English, don't just focus on the subject. But also on its category. Like 1st person singular, 2nd person singular. etc...

NOTE: Subject is not only these, there are so many subjects.
    App Log = You People.
        You People (Complete) = Subject.
            But its you, so it doesn't meant that it is 2nd person singular.
            It is 2nd person plural. Because of the context.
            So make sure to identify the subject properly.
