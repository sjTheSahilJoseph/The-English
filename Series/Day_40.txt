Conjunctions.

Conjunctions plays a huge role in sentences.
They link sentences.

Some conjunctions have so many meanings.
If the same conjunction is present at the start of sentence, it's meaning could be different.
Or if the same conjunction is present at the end, or between the sentence, it's meaning can change differently.

The Problem.
Let's say I have to say these 2 sentences:
    SJ is a good boy.
    JS is a good boy.
Now I have to connect them. So I'll use "and" conjunction.
    SJ and JS are good boys.

2nd Example:
    I was unwell.
    I didn't go to the office yesterday.
Linked:
    Since I was unwell, I didn't go to the office yesterday.

Start

And
    -> Or
    Practice
        SJ and JS are good friends.

    -> Ya
    Practice
        You can buy this book or that book.
        What shall I give you, this or that?
        What do I give you, this or that?

But
    -> Lekin, Par, Parantoo
    -> Siwaye, Ilawa
        // We can also use "Except" for siwaye, ilawa.
    -> Blke
        // We can also use "Rather" for blke.
    Practice
        SJ or JS achy dost hain par woh aek dusre se larte hain.
            SJ and JS are good friends but they fight with each other.
        Woh bht samajhdar hai par uske pas paise nhi hain.
            He is very intelligent but he doesn't have money.
        Mai tumhare ghar ke siwa kahi bhi ja skta hoon.
            I can go anywhere but not your home.
            I can go anywhere except your home.
        Mai kuch bhi kar skta hu siwaye tumhe peetne ke.
            I can do anything but not beat you.

            He can eat anything except chicken.
        Yeh pen nhi blke pencil hai.
            This is not a pen but a pencil.

                // Same rule.
