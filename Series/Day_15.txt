Simple Sentence -> Present -> Category 1.

(Hai, Hain, Ho, Hoon, etc...).

Interrogative:
    For Yes/No questions, we dont' have to use WH-Family in Interrogative Sentences.
        For Example:
            1. What SJ is a good boy? = Wrong.
            2. Is SJ a good boy? = Correct.
        We use Auxilary Verb at this case before subject.
    And For, explainational questions. Like more detail, We use WH-Family in Interrogative Sentences.
        For Example:
            1. What is your name?
                We can't answer with "yes/no". We have to explain in someother way.

Is = 3rd person singular.
Am = I. (1st Person Singular).
Are = 2nd Person Singular, Plural, 1st Person Plural, 3rd Person Plural.

We combine (has been / have been).
And for negative (has not been/ have not been).

Affirmative:
    Subject + Is/Am/Are + Object.
Negative:
    Subject + Is/Am/Are + Not + Object.
Interrogative:
    <WH> + Is/Am/Are + Subject + Object?
    Is/Am/Are + Subject + Object?
Negative Interrogation:
    <WH> + Is/Am/Are + Subject + not + Object?
    Is/Am/Are + Subject + not + Object?
Special Case:
    Interrogative:
        <Wh - Subject> + Is/Am+Are + Object?
    Negative Interrogative:
        <Wh - Subject> + Is/Am/Are + not + Object?

NOTE:
    When we talk about time in these kind of sentences, we don't use Is/am/are. We use has been/have been.
    And for interrogative, we use has not been/have not been.
    We use has with 3rd peson singualar, and for rest, we use have.
    
Practice:
    SJ is a good boy. -> Affirmative.
    Is SJ a good boy? -> Interrogative.
    Is SJ not a good boy? -> Negative Interrogative.
    Why is SJ not a good boy? -> Interrogative.

    SJ is asleep. -> Affirmative.
    SJ isn't asleep. -> Negative.
    Is SJ asleep? -> Interrogative.
    Why is SJ asleep? -> Interrogative.
    With whom is SJ asleep? -> Interrogative.
    Where is SJ asleep? -> Interrogative.
    My fingers are swollen. -> Affirmative. (Plural).
    My fingers aren't swollen. -> Negative.

    Why are you at home? -> Interrogative.
    With whom are you at home? -> Interrogative.
    You have been at home since morning. -> Affirmative but with time and 2nd person singular but we use "you" and it is considered as plural.
    He has been at home since morning. -> Affirmative but with time and 3rd person singular subject.
    You have not been at home since morning. -> Negative.
    He has not been at home since morning. -> Negative.
    Have you been at home since morning? -> Interrogative (we put "have/has" before subject and after subject we put "been").
    Has he been at home since morning? -> Interrogative (we put "have/has" before subject and after subject we put "been").
    Have you not been at home since morning? -> Negative Interrogate (we put "have/has" before subject and after subject we put "not been").
    Has he not been at home since morning? -> Negative Interrogative (we put "have/has" before subject and after subject we put "not been").

Since: (Since a point in time in the past).
    For Example:
        Since 2 o'clock / 2 AM / 12 PM, etc...
        Since 2005, January 2020, etc...
        Since Morning / Evening, etc...
        Since Monday / Tuesday, etc...
        Since yesterday / day before yesterday / birthday / aniversary / that day, etc...
        Since childhood / aduldhood / birdh / begining, etc...
        Since you are here, / Since I left, / Since you called me, etc...
            This is called clause, (incomplete sentence).

For: (For a period / Duration of time).
    For 2 seconds / 2 Minutes / 2 hours / 2 days / 2 weeks / 2 months / 2 decads / 2 centuries, etc...
    For a long / For a long time / For a while / For a short while, etc...
    For many days / For many hours / For many years / For many centuries, etc...
    For few seconds / For few minutes / For few hours / For few days, etc...

NOTE:
    I've been at home since yesterday. => correct.
    I'm at home since yesterday. => wrong.
    I'm at home. => correct.
    I've been at home. => wrong. (because now I'm telling the current state).

Practice Continue:
    Since when have you been at home? -> we used "have you been" because the context is of a time specific sentence. So we use "has/have been" when talking about a time. We can also use "For how long".
    For how long have you been at home? -> we used "have you been" because the context is of a time specific sentence. So we use "has/have been" when talking about a time. We can also use "Since when".
    (If I ask you "Since when..." then the answer should be in since format like: "Since 2 o'clock.)
    (If I ask you "For how long..." then the answer should be in for format like: "For 2 hours".)

When the object is not known, we simply use "There".
And It's better to use "There" as subject.

For Example:
    If we wanna start a story,
        We can say "A boy is" (Aek ladka hai).
            What is the subject?
                A boy.
            What is the object?
                Null.
        So we use:
            A boy is there. => correct but we use (There as subject).
            There is a boy. => there as subject, and it's also correct.
                There as subject.
                And whole sentence is correct.
        More Practice:
            Four boys are there. => correct.
            There are four boys. => correct. (there as subject).
            There is no boy. => Correct. (Singular = is).
            There are no boys. => Correct. (Plural = are).
            There is a man.
            There is no man.
            There is no man there.
            No man is there.
            There is no option.
            There are a few taps.
            There are many trees.
            There is a man at home.
            There is no man at my shop.
            There are a few taps over there.
                We can use "over" before there (it's optional and it's correct).
            There are a few taps there.
            There are many trees in the forest.

Special Case:
    Interrogative:
        <WH - Subject> + is/am/are + Object?
    Negative Interrogative:
        <WH-Subject> + is/am/are + Object?

Basically when <WH> is also plays a role as subject, that's special case.
    Reffering the subject.
    We make sentences like simple affirmative but <WH> as subject.

For Example:
    1. Kon baitha hua hai? => No subject specified, basically Who is the subject itself.
        Who is sitting?
        Who is not sitting?
    2. Kon kon mere sath hain? => No subject specified, question subject is the subject.
        Who all are with me?
        Who all are not with me?
    3. Waha kiska bhai hai? => Same.
        Whose brother is there?
        Whose brother is not there?
        Whose brothers are there?
        Whose brothers are not there?
    4. Wahan kon si shirt rakhi hui hai? => Same.
        Which shirt is kept there?
        Which shirt is not kept there?
    5. Ap me se kitne office me hain?
        How many of you are in the office?
    6. Table par kitna paisa para hua hai?
        How much money is lying on the table.
    7. Class me kiski behan baithi hai?
        Whose sister is sitting in the class?
    8. Tumhara konsa bhai mere sath tha?
        Which brother of yours is with me?
