Koi to hoga jise apki sach me parwah ho, akhir itne dost hain apke.
	There must be someone who really cares for you, after all, you have so many friends.

Har cheez ki had hoti hai, yeh nhi ke kisi ko bhi kuch bhi keh do.
	There is a limit to everything, it's not that you say anything to anyone.

App jo marzi kar lo, us se acha bowler dhundne se bhi nhi milne wala.
	No matter what you do, you are not gonna find a better bowler than him.

Mai ne aek baat kia keh di ke log mere peechy e par gaye.
	I just said one thing and people turned after me.

Aesa sirf tumhe lagta hai; varna kisi se bhi puch lo, koi uski tarafdari nhi karne wala.
	Only you feel so; otherwise, ask anyone, nobody is gonna support him.

Jitna socho ge utna tumhara hi dimag kharab ho ga.
	The more you think, the more your mind will get spoiled.

Sochne ko pura din pra tha, aram se soch lete. Itni jaldbazi kiu ki?
	You had the whole day to think, you should have taken your time. Why did you make a hurry?

Jo kehte hain tumhe kuch nhi ata, zara unse pucho unhe kia ata hai.
	Those who say you know nothing, just ask them what they know.
