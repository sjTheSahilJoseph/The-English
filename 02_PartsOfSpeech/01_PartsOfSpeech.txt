What are Parts of Speech?
    Many people will answer this in that way: Parts of Speech are Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Adverb, etc...
        But the thing is that, They are the Parts of Speech. Not the answer to this question that: What is Parts of Speech?
    Actually, English language is made up of Words.
    Interesting thing: In English, the words are also called speech.
    The words which a language is made up of have some categories, and those are called Parts.
        Those words categories are called Parts of Speech.
    It means that, in a sentence each word have a category, so the category, kind, type of word which is used in a sentence, is called Parts of Speech.

In English there are 8 Parts of Speech. And those are:
    1. Noun
    2. Pronoun
    3. Verb
    4. Adverb
    5. Adjective
    6. Preposition
    7. Conjunction
    8. Interjection
    9. Article
        there's 9th one which is called: Article.
        But this is a type of Adjective so, We don't include it as a primary Part of Speech.
    There're 8 Parts of Speech.

1. Verb.
    Verb is used to tell the Action and State of Being.
        For Example:
            1. I go to office daily.
            2. I am a teacher.
        So those words are verb:
            go, write, play, is, am, will, etc...

2. Noun.
    Noun is the name of anything.
        For Example:
            SJ, United States, Table, Dog, etc...
            1. SJ lives in United States. => SJ is the Noun.
    By the way, If any word, non-noun word, is containing Article at the start. (A, An, The). Then, It's a Noun.
    & also, 
    When we put s/es after the word, and it becomes the plural. Basically it has a plural form. (Man -> Men etc...(Plural)) Then, It is also a Noun.
        For Example:
            The Girl = Noun.
            Girls = Noun.

3. Pronoun.
    Pronoun is used to replace the noun.
        For Example:
            I, We, You, Me, My, Ourselves, etc...
            1. SJ is tired. He (Pronoun) wants to sleep.

4. Adjective.
    Pronounce: (d is silent between a and j).
    Adjective modifies a noun / pronoun.
    In word Adjective, the Ad is "addition" like adding something.
    It is combined with noun / pronoun.
        For Example:
            Big, Happy, Green, Crazy, etc...
            1. She has a pink hat. (pink = Adjective).
            2. SJ is very handsome. (handsome = Adjective).
        
5. Adverb.
    Again, Ad means it is adding something to something.
    The Adverb modifies a Verb / Adjective / Adverb itself.
        For Example:
            Slowly, Very, Always, Never, Tomorrow, Here, etc...
        1. She is walking slowly. (slowly = adverb). // Qualifies the Verb.
        2. She is very beautiful. (very = adverb). // Qualifies the Adjective.
        3. She is walking very slowly. (very = adverb, slowly = adverb). // Qualifies the Adverb.
    Generally, The Adverbs are the replies of these words:
        How, Where, When, How often, To what extent.

6. Preposition.
    It shows the relationship of a noun / pronoun to another word.
        For Example:
            at, in, with, near, between, etc...
            1. I live in United States. (in = Preposition).
            2. There is a box under the table. (under = Preposition).
            3. I am fond of coffee. (of = Preposition).
    Preposition is a word which comes before the position of noun or pronoun. And then shows the relationship between noun / pronoun with other words.

7. Conjunction.
    Con means Together.
    Junction means to join.
    Conjunction - Joining Word.
    Conjunction are the words which joins two clauses / words / or sentences.
        For Example:
            and, or, but, because, since, etc...
            1. SJ and Sahil are friends. (and = Conjunction).
            2. he was guilty so he was punished. (so = Conjunction).

8. Interjection.
    Like in Exclamatory Sentences, we express our feelings, emotions stuff.
    So, those words are Interjection.
    Interjection is expressive word.
        For Example:
            Wow!, Oh!, Oh Shit!, Yo!, Ouch!, Hurrah!, etc...
            1. Ouch! That hurt. (Ouch = Interjection).
            2. Yo! I love to listen rap music. (Yo = Interjection).

All 8 Parts of Speech in Short:
    1. Verb = Action / State.
    2. Noun = Naming Word.
    3. Pronoun = Replaces a noun.
    4. Adjective = Modifies Noun / Pronoun.
    5. Adverb = Modifies Verb / Adjective / Adverb.
    6. Preposition = Shows Relationship.
    7. Conjunction = Joining word.
    8. Interjection = Expressive word.

Important Point about Parts of Speech:
    Any Word in English Language, Must be in one of those Parts of Speech.
    But the thing is that one word can be in many parts of speech category at same time.
    It all depends on the function of the word.
        For Example:
        1. So:
            1. I am so sorry. (so is Adverb here. (sorry is Adjective here. So the word which modifies the Adjective, verb, adverb is called Adverb.)).
            2. He was poor so they helped him. (so is Conjunction here. He was poor = Independent Clause 1, They helped him. = Independent Clause 2. So the word that joins 2 clauses is called Conjunction.)
    That's why we learn Functional English.
    We have to see the whole sentence to identify the word that which part of speech is using here.
