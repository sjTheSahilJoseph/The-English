Note: Not even a single sentence can be made without a Main Verb.

Main Verb.
    Any Main Verb word must be is in one of these forms.
    Main Verb has 5 Forms.
        1. Verb 1st Form. Base Form (Plural).
        2. Verb 2nd Form. Past Form.
        3. Verb 3rd Form. Past Participle.
        4. Verb 4th Form (ing). Present Participle.
        5. Verb 5th Form (s/es). Base Form (Singular).
    For Example:
        1. He writes poems. => (writes = main verb). [Verb 5th Form (s/es). Base Form (Singular)].
        2. They played football. => (played = main verb). [Verb 2nd form. Past Form ]

Important Points:
    No Sentence can be made without main verb. Any any main verb must be in 1 to 5 verb forms.
    In English Language, Helping verb is not as important as main verb to make a sentence. But main verb is super important.
    A sentence can be built without using Helping Verb.
    Helping verb can or cannot be present.

Helping Verb as Main Verb:
    First take a look at these sentence:
        1. I am a teacher.
        2. She was a singer.
        3. I have four sons.
        What is the verb in these sentences?
            1. I am a teacher. => (am = verb).
            2. She was a singer. => (was = verb).
            3. I have four sons. => (have = verb).
        But which verb? Helping or Main? As I said before: In English, no sentence can be complete without MAIN VERB.
            So, Basically, These are Main Verbs here. How? Because now they are no longer a helping verb. Because Helping Verb means helping to a verb. But when there is no main verb present in that sentence, these helping verbs become Main Verb then.
        Why they have to become main verb?
            Because in English, no sentence can be completed without main verb.
        Helping Verb cannot be a helping verb without a main verb. So that's why, If no main verb, then the helping verb become main verb.
    How can I identify that the helping verb is helping verb or a main verb in sentence?
        If sentence have a main verb and before main verb a helping verb, then the helping verb is helping verb.
        But, If sentence do not have main verb, but a helping verb. Then, the helping verb is it's main verb.
    As I mentioned earlier, If there's a sentence, there's a main verb (doesn't matter the main verb or helping verb as main verb), if there's a main verb, it must be in one of these 5 forms.
        1. Verb 1st Form. Base Form (Plural).
        2. Verb 2nd Form. Past Form.
        3. Verb 3rd Form. Past Participle.
        4. Verb 4th Form (ing). Present Participle.
        5. Verb 5th Form (s/es). Base Form (Singular).
    So, when primary helping verbs become main verb in a sentence, their 5 forms looks like this:  
        +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
        | Verb 1st Form | Verb 2nd Form | Verb 3rd Form | Verb 4th Form | Verb 5th Form |
        +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
        | Be,Am,Are     | Was, Were     | Been          | Being         | Is            |
        | Have          | Had           | Had           | Having        | Has           |
        | Do            | Did           | Done          | Doing         | Does          |
        +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
    Let's take a look at those sentences again:
        1. I am a teacher. => (am = verb 1st form).
            It is simple present tense, Most people think that in only if a sentence contains s/es on verb's 1st form, then only it is a simple present tense. But it's not true. As we can see here.
        2. She was a singer. => (was = verb 2nd form).
            It is a simple past tense.
        3. I have four sons. => (have = verb 1st form).
            It is a simple present tense.
