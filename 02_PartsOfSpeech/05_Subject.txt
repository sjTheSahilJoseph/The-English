What is Subject?
    A subject must be a Noun or a Pronoun.
    Remember something?
        The object also must be a Noun or a Pronoun.
    In a sentence, when we call anything subject, it must be a Noun or a Pronoun.
        If its not a Noun or a Pronoun, it is also not a subject.
    Before verb, when we see bunch of other words which are different parts of speech like Noun, Pronoun, Adverb, etc...
        In order to identify the subject, we have to make sure that the word which is Noun or a Pronoun can be subject, not other.
    But sometimes, it becomes really hard to find a subject, Sometimes, a sentence contains more than 1 noun or so.
        Let's learn about Subject.

For Example:
    1. A dog is barking.
        What is the verb here?
            Is.
                Is is the form of Be.
                Is is working here as helping verb.
                    Because there is another verb (Main verb = Bark) is present.
            Bark.
                Bark is the main verb here.
            In this sentence the main verb and helping verb, both are present.
            By adding helping verb and main verb, it becomes one verb.
                Is Barking = Verb.
        The thing is that if a verb is present in a sentence, it can never happen without a subject.
        When a subject is present then also a verb must must be present in a sentence.
        Before verb a dog is written, so it is quite obvious that dog is the subject.
            Let's confirm this:
                Subject must be a Noun / Pronoun.
                    Dog = Noun.
                        A dog = Article.
                            It means that this is the noun.
    2. We shall go to the party.
        What are verbs here?
            Shall = Modal helping verb.
            Go = Main verb.
            Helping verb and Main verb are one.
            So the verb is shall go.
        If there is a verb, so it is obvious that is also have subject.
            We = subject.
                Let's Confirm.
                    Subject = Noun / Pronoun.
                    We = Pronoun.
                    Yes, it is a subject.
        What is to?
            To = Preposition.
            Any word after the Preposition is the object of Preposition.
                the part = object.
                    Let's confirm:
                        Doesn't matter if the object is the object of verb or object of Preposition, it is always a noun / pronoun.
                        the party = noun.
                        the = Article for noun.
                        party = name.
    3. A cool guy is looking here.
        Verb:
            Is = Helping Verb.
            Looking = Main Verb.
            Helping Verb + Main Verb = One Single Verb.
        Now let's find the subject.
            We have 2 Words:
                1. A Cool
                2. Guy
                We know that group of words can never be subject.
                So then What is the subject here?
                    We know that subject must be a noun or a pronoun.
                Let's do one thing, check that "a" article is for whom? Weather its for cool or for guy?
                    A article is for Guy.
                        Because Cool is adjective.
                    We can make a sentence without cool but not without guy.
                    So A is for Guy.
                Subject:
                    Subject = Guy.
                    Guy = Noun.
                    Article = preset.
                Okay so what is "here"?
                    Here is Adverb.
                        It is modifying the verb (is looking).
                        It is giving extra information about a guy who is looking. but where? here.

            Let's check if its object of verb.
                In order to see if the object is object of verb or not, we need to make sure that the object is noun/pronoun and it is giving the reply of what or whom in a sentence.
                    Dead men tell what?
                        No tales.
